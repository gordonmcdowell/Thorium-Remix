0:00:00.340,0:00:05.060
Smagā ūdens reaktors izmantos apmēram 0.7
procentus no urāna enerģijas, bet

0:00:05.060,0:00:08.630
vieglā ūdens reaktors izmantos apmēram pusi
no procenta. Tie abi ir šausmīgi.

0:00:08.630,0:00:13.380
Normālā spiedienā ūdens vārās 100 grādu
temperatūrā. Tā ne tuvu nav pietiekami augsta

0:00:13.380,0:00:18.280
lai efektīvi radītu elektrību. Tāpēc ar ūdeni
dzesētiem reaktoriem jāstrādā virs 70 atmosfēru 

0:00:18.280,0:00:22.310
spiedienā. Ar ūdeni dzesētam reaktoram ir
nepieciešams spiedkatls.

0:00:22.310,0:00:24.529
kas var radīt negadījumus...

0:00:24.529,0:00:28.760
Ja pazūd spiediens, ūdens, kas bijis
300 grādu temperatūrā [puff]

0:00:28.760,0:00:34.320
pārvēršas tvaikā. Tā tilpums palielinās apmēram
1000 reizes. Ja nav pieejama avārijas dzesēšana,

0:00:34.320,0:00:38.010
un reaktora serde neatrodas dzesēšanas šķidrumā,
tā var pārkarst un izkust.

0:00:38.010,0:00:43.829
Visi šie apsvērumi nosaka kodolreaktora celtnes izskatu.
Ja noplūst dzesēšanas šķidruma tvaiki,

0:00:43.829,0:00:44.739
tie paliek ēkā.

0:00:44.739,0:00:50.129
Mūsdienās visplašāk sastopamie reaktori izmanto urāna oksīdu 
Tas ir keramisks materiāls, kas ir ķīmiski ļoti stabils,

0:00:50.129,0:00:54.079
bet slikti vada siltumu.
Ja sistēmā pazūd spiediens un ūdens iztvaiko,

0:00:54.079,0:00:57.610
drīz vien pēc tam izkūst kodoldegvielas stieņi, 
un kopā ar tiem arī radioaktīvie kodolu sadalīšanās

0:00:57.610,0:00:58.129
produkti.

0:00:58.129,0:01:03.629
Tāpēc ir vairākas avārijas sistēmas, kas
nodrošina, ka serde vienmēr atrodas šķidrumā.

0:01:03.629,0:01:08.649
Ja tas neizdodas, tad notiek tāda avārija kā Fukušimā.
Viņiem bija vairāki rezerves dīzeļģeneratori,

0:01:08.649,0:01:13.609
un bija ļoti liela varbūtība, ka vismaz kāds no tiem
darbosies. Bet cunami vilnis appludināja

0:01:13.609,0:01:14.369
tos visus.

0:01:14.369,0:01:16.929
Cilvēki vienmēr jautā: "Vai kodolenerģija ir droša?",
un pirmais, ko es atbildu ir: "Kura?"

0:01:16.929,0:01:20.990
Ir tūkstošiem veidu, kā izmantot kodolenerģiju.
Vai automašīna ir droša?

0:01:20.990,0:01:21.240
Tad par kuru iet runa?

0:01:21.240,0:01:24.810
Man ir paveicies, uzzināt arī par citiem
kodolenerģijas veidiem.

0:01:24.810,0:01:26.549
Piemēram, par šķidrā fluorīda torija reaktoriem.

0:01:26.549,0:01:30.749
Šajā reaktorā mēs varam toriju sadedzināt pilnībā, atšķirībā
no tiem, kuros sadedzina tika nelielu urāna daļu,

0:01:30.749,0:01:32.719
kā tas ir tipiskā ar ūdeni dzesējamā reaktorā.

0:01:32.719,0:01:37.349
To nedzesē ar ūdeni, un tas neizmanto cietu 
kodoldegvielu. Tajā kā kodoldegvielu izmanto

0:01:37.349,0:01:42.380
fluorīda sāļus. Lai tos izkausētu, jums tie ir jāuzkarsē
līdz aptuveni 400 grādiem,

0:01:42.380,0:01:46.459
bet priekš kodolenerģijas ražošanas tas
patiesībā ir ļoti labi.

0:01:46.459,0:01:50.700
Un patiesi brīnišķīgi ir tas, ka šādam reaktoram nav
jādarbojas augstā spiedienā. Šādam reaktoram dzesēšanai 

0:01:50.700,0:01:54.989
nav nepieciešams ūdens, līdz ar to, nav nekā tāda,
kas var strauji mainīt savu tilpumu.

0:01:54.989,0:01:59.149
Ja, izmantojot cietu kodoldegvielu ir jāuztraucas par
tās izkušanu, tad fluorīdu reaktorā

0:01:59.149,0:02:00.599
degviela jau ir izkususi.

0:02:00.599,0:02:04.389
Normālos apstākļos jūs kā avārijas vārstu izmantojat 

0:02:04.389,0:02:08.989
cauruli, kurai vienkārši pūšot aukstu gaisu.
Ja avārijas gadījumā jūs stacijā pazaudējat strāvu,

0:02:08.989,0:02:13.400
ventilators apstājas, sasalušie sāļi izkūst,

0:02:13.400,0:02:18.269
un caur šo cauruli šķidrā fluorīda kodoldegviela no reaktora izplūst

0:02:18.269,0:02:20.769
dzesēšanas traukā.

0:02:20.769,0:02:25.209
Ar ūdeni dzesējamos reaktoros jums parasti ir
nepieciešama barošana, lai nodošinātu

0:02:25.209,0:02:29.620
ūdens cirkulāciju un dzesēšanu, un nepieļautu serdes izkušanu.
Bet ja pazūd strāva LFTR reaktorā, tas apstājas

0:02:29.620,0:02:32.420
pats no sevis, bez jebkādas cilvēku līdzdalības.

0:02:32.420,0:02:37.519
Tam ir vienkārši apbrīnojams drošības līmenis pat tad,
ja reaktoram ir kāds bojājums.

0:02:37.519,0:02:41.430
Torijs ir plaši sastopams dabiskajos zemes iežos un ir

0:02:41.430,0:02:46.040
daudz biežāk sastopams nekā urāns. Tajā ir pieejams tik daudz 
enerģijas, ka jūs varat savu mūža patēriņu uzglabāt

0:02:46.040,0:02:50.299
torija gabaliņā, kuru varat novietot uz plaukstas.
Toriju var izmantot kodolreaktorā aptuveni 200 reizes efektīvāk

0:02:50.299,0:02:54.879
nekā tagad izmanto urānu.
LFTR reaktorā var izmantot gandrīz visu torijā pieejamo enerģiju,

0:02:54.879,0:03:00.140
un tas ļauj būtiski samazināt radioaktīvo atkritumu daudzumu
vairāk nekā 100 reizes, salīdzinot ar urānu

0:03:00.140,0:03:02.469
un vairāk nekā miljons reizes, salīdzinot ar fosilo kurināmo.

0:03:02.469,0:03:06.519
Mums tāpat būs nepieciešama šķidra degviela, lai darbinātu
transportu un iekārtas, tomēr mēs to varēsim radīt, 

0:03:06.519,0:03:10.239
izmantojot oglekļa dioksīdu no gaisa un ūdeni,
tieši tāpat, kā to dara daba.

0:03:10.239,0:03:14.719
Mēs varam iegūt ūdeņradi, sašķeļot ūdeni un 
kopā ar ogļskābo gāzi no gaisa

0:03:14.719,0:03:20.219
varam sintezēt tādas degvielas kā metanolu, 
amoniju vai dimetilu

0:03:20.219,0:03:23.629
un jebkurš no tiem var aizvietot šobrīd izmantoto
dīzeļdegvielu.

0:03:23.629,0:03:28.769
Iedomājieties oglekļa neitrālu benzīnu un dīzeli,
ko var iegūt katrs pats un ilgtspējīgi

0:03:28.769,0:03:34.719
Jūs redzat, ka pēc izplatības dabā urāns ir salīdzināms
ar sudrabu un platīnu. Vai varat iedomāties enerģijas

0:03:34.719,0:03:39.209
iegūšanu no platīna? Bet šobrīd mēs ar saviem
kodolreaktoriem darām tieši to!

0:03:39.209,0:03:44.670
Mēs dedzinām šo ļoti reti sastopamo elementu, tā vietā,
lai dedzinātu daudz vairāk izplatīto toriju.

0:03:44.670,0:03:49.290
Daži cilvēki, kas ir dabas draugi, parasti saka:
"Bet kodolenerģija nav ilgtspējīga!

0:03:49.290,0:03:53.409
Mums agri vai vēlu pietrūks urāna."
Ja iet runa par šodienas tehnoloģijām,

0:03:53.409,0:04:00.180
tad šajā punktā es viņiem piekrītu.
2007. gadā, lai saražotu visu mums nepieciešamo enerģiju,

0:04:00.180,0:04:05.529
mēs izmantojām 5 miljardus tonnu ogļu,
31 miljardu barelus naftas, 5 triljonus kubikmetrus dabasgāzes

0:04:05.529,0:04:07.670
un 65 tūkstošus tonnu urāna.

0:04:07.670,0:04:11.900
Man ir draugs, kurš ir uzsācis retzemju metālu raktuves izveidi
Misūri štatā. Es viņam jautāju: "Džim, cik daudz torija

0:04:11.900,0:04:16.709
tu gada laikā varētu iegūt?"
Un viņš atbild: "Domāju, ka kādus 5000 tonnu."

0:04:16.709,0:04:22.860
5000 tonnu torija var nodrošināt visas pasaules enerģijas prasības.

0:04:22.860,0:04:26.630
Un viņš turpina: "Un uz pasaules ir miljoniem tādu pašu raktuvju
kā manējā. Tās ir labas raktuves,

0:04:26.630,0:04:30.300
bet tās nav nav ne ar ko īpašas. Nav tā, ka toriju varētu iegūt
tikai dažās vietās uz pasaules."

0:04:30.300,0:04:35.960
Katru reizi, kad cilvēks apguva kāju jaunu enerģijas avotu,
tas ir radījis pamatīgas sociālās sekas.

0:04:35.960,0:04:41.669
Tūkstošiem gadu cilvēcē pastāvēja verdzība.

0:04:41.669,0:04:45.830
Tagad, tā vietā, lai par vergiem izmantotu citus cilvēkus,
mēs kā vergu esam iemācījušies izmantot oglekli,

0:04:45.830,0:04:48.330
un esam kļuvuši par civilizētiem cilvēkiem.

0:04:48.330,0:04:54.750
Torija enerģijas blīvums ir miljoniem reižu lielāks
nekā oglekļa-ūdeņraža saitē.

0:04:54.750,0:04:59.270
Ko gan tas varētu dot cilvēcei?
Un mums tas nekad neizbeigsies.

0:04:59.270,0:05:06.270
Tas vienkārši ir pārāk izplatīts.

0:05:12.910,0:05:19.910
Mūsu Facebook lapas apmeklētāju sadalījums ir
aptuveni 87% vīriešu un 13% sieviešu.

0:06:10.259,0:06:15.300
Es nekad neesmu bijusi kodolenerģijas atbalstītāja.
Vai tāpēc, ka tā ir saistīta ar patērēšanu?

0:06:15.300,0:06:20.610
Tā ļauj mums nepārtraukti palielināt patēriņu,
un es uzskatu, ka tas nav ilgtspējīgi.

0:06:20.610,0:06:23.889
Vai domā, ka citas enerģijas formas novērsīs mūsu
vēlmi tērēt?

0:06:23.889,0:06:29.550
Ja mēs to ar laiku iztērēsim, tad jā. 
Es domāju, ka mums ir jāsāk ierobežot sevi un atkalizmantot,

0:06:29.550,0:06:31.129
tā vietā, lai tikai ķertos pie arvien jauniem avotiem.

0:06:31.129,0:06:34.750
Tad kā ir ar Sauli? Saule spīdēs vienmēr,
vējš pūtīs vienmēr.

0:06:34.750,0:06:36.110
Tie dod mums dzīvību.

0:06:36.110,0:06:38.580
Enerģijas auzu tume. 

0:06:38.580,0:06:42.240
Jā. Domāju, ka mums būtu labāk jānovērtē to, kas
mums ir, tomēr es varu runāt tikai par sevi.

0:06:42.240,0:06:47.690
Tātad tu intuitīvi augstāk kā enerģijas avotu vērtē
sauli un vēju, bet ne tādus avotus, kas ir līdzīgi

0:06:47.690,0:06:49.729
naftai un gāzei.

0:06:49.729,0:06:54.050
Raugoties uz to, kā mēs tos izmantojam tagad,
un uz to, ka mēs visticamāk paplašināsim,

0:06:54.050,0:06:58.740
gan saules, gan vēja izmantošanu,
pieņemu, ka tie radīs vēl lielākus satricinājumus.

0:06:58.740,0:07:04.229
Vai tu saproti, cik lielu ietekmi uz dabu atstāj saules un vēja
izmantošana.

0:07:04.229,0:07:05.590
Tie aizņem ļoti daudz vietas.

0:07:05.590,0:07:06.220
Jā.

0:07:06.220,0:07:11.479
Lai nepieļautu pārlieku lielu ietekmi uz dabu,
cik daudz saules un vēja stacijas

0:07:11.479,0:07:12.330
mēs varam atļauties?

0:07:12.330,0:07:16.629
Mums tā ir jāizmanto ļoti dažādos veidos, un jāapvieno 
ar jau esošajiem enerģijas avotiem.

0:07:16.629,0:07:20.009
Patiesībā es to esmu pārbaudījis pats savā mājā.
Man uz jumta ir saules baterijas,

0:07:20.009,0:07:23.650
bet tas, cik enerģijas tās dod ir daudz par maz.
To dotā enerģija arvien samazinās,

0:07:23.650,0:07:26.789
Un, katru reizi, kad es kāpju uz jumta tās tīrīt,
es riskēju ar savu dzīvību.

0:07:26.789,0:07:27.039

0:07:26.990,0:07:29.210
Mums ir profesionāli augstkāpēji, kas var to izdarīt.

0:07:29.210,0:07:33.720
Mans brālis ir augstkāpējs. Tas ir smags darbs.
Tāpēc tāds 21 gadu vecs kā viņš,

0:07:33.720,0:07:37.159
kas kāpj uz jumtiem, var nopelnīt tik daudz.
Jo viņš katru reizi riskē ar savu dzīvību tieši tāpat,

0:07:37.159,0:07:37.580
kā ar to riskē ogļrači.

0:07:37.580,0:07:42.699
Vai tu domā, ka uzlikt enerģijas patēriņa ierobežojumus 
ir pareizi?

0:07:42.699,0:07:43.979
Jā, es tā domāju.

0:07:43.979,0:07:50.020
Pāreja un mazāku enerģijas izmantošanas dzīvesveidu
pilnīgi noteikti būs pāreja 

0:07:50.020,0:07:50.780
uz zemāku dzīves kvalitāti.

0:07:50.780,0:07:54.500
Lai arī efektivitātes celšana ir vērtīga un iespējams,
ka ar to varam samazināt patēriņu par 25%

0:07:54.500,0:07:58.789
no no kopējā enerģijas patēriņa, tas ne tuvu nav
pietiekami, lai novērstu vajadzību izmantot

0:07:58.789,0:07:59.270
fosilo kurināmo.

0:07:59.270,0:08:02.849
Piemēram, varam piekrist Elizabetei Mejai, kad viņa 
saka:

0:08:02.849,0:08:05.780
"Mums ir jāpāriet uz energoefektīvāku dzīvesstilu"

0:08:05.780,0:08:10.060
Kad iet runa par Kalgari naftas smiltīm, var

0:08:10.060,0:08:14.550
redzēt kas būtu pieļaujams, un kas — ne,
runājot par energoefektivitāti.

0:09:41.100,0:09:45.740
Protams, mums ir jāveicina energoefektīvāks dzīves
stils. Tomēr, cik tālu mēs varam iet?

0:09:45.740,0:09:50.890
Vai tā vietā nebūtu labāk apgūt labākus enerģijas
iegūšanas veidus?

0:09:50.890,0:09:52.730
Es tā nedomāju. Pat ne tuvu tam.

0:09:52.730,0:09:54.760
Tu neuzskata vēju un sauli par...

0:09:54.760,0:09:59.170
Mēs esam mēģinājuši apgūt vēju un Sauli gadu desmitus.
Un tagad tie sastāda procenta daļas

0:09:59.170,0:10:04.260
no ASV kopējās saražotās enerģijas.
Vēja apgūšanu ierobežo

0:10:04.260,0:10:10.320
enerģijas blīvums. Piemēram, tu parādi man triju
megavatu vēja staciju. Bet, ja man ir 3 gigavatu

0:10:10.320,0:10:14.720
kodolspēkstacija, tad tā viena aizstāj 1000 šādas
vēja stacijas.

0:10:14.720,0:10:18.060
Vējš vidēji ir izmantojams tikai 15% jeb vienu sesto
daļa no visa kopējā laika.

0:10:18.060,0:10:21.760
Tāpēc iepriekšējais salīdzinājums nav pareizs,
jo viena stacija darbojas nepārtraukti,

0:10:21.760,0:10:25.670
bet otra tikai sesto daļu no visa laika.
Piemēram, ja tad, kad es ieslēdzu mašīnas aizdedzi

0:10:25.670,0:10:29.470
un varbūtība, ka mašīna iedarbosies ir tikai

0:10:29.470,0:10:33.910
viena sestā daļa, cik noderīga man tā būtu?
Vēja industrija mums saka:

0:10:33.910,0:10:37.940
"Tas ir normāli, Čelsija. Tev tikai vajag sešas
automašīnas." Enerģija ir par un ap uzticamību.

0:10:37.940,0:10:44.540
Mēs to varētu atrisināt, izmantojot baterijas,
vai tad tās nevar izmantot 

0:10:44.540,0:10:45.470
ne tikai klēpjdatoriem?

0:10:45.470,0:10:49.690
Bateriju izmantošana enerģētikā ir ļoti, ļoti
dārga. To nekad nevarēs ieviest

0:10:49.690,0:10:53.770
kā visaptverošu risinājumu, jo vienas vatstundas
saglabāšana baterijā ir

0:10:53.770,0:10:55.280
ir ļoti dārga.

0:10:55.280,0:10:58.170
Es nerunāju par litija jonu baterijām, es runāju
par daudz lētākām baterijām.

0:10:58.170,0:11:01.930
Piemēram, svina-skābes baterijas ir salīdzinoši lētas.
Tā kā tad būtu vajadzīgas milzīgi daudzas tādas, 

0:11:01.930,0:11:04.730
ir labāk, ka ir daudz lētas baterijas, nekā dažas dārgas.

0:11:04.730,0:11:09.050
Bet ja mums būtu augstas vadītspējas... kā tās sauc?

0:11:09.050,0:11:09.480
Supravadītāju?

0:11:09.480,0:11:10.870
Tie visi ir izkliedēti enerģijas avoti.

0:11:10.870,0:11:14.210
Ja esi uzbūvējis elektropārvades līniju,
tu vēlies, lai tā atmaksājas.

0:11:14.210,0:11:17.040
Tāpēc tev ir nepieciešams, lai tajā plūstu strāva
praktiski visu laiku.

0:11:17.040,0:11:21.140
Pretējā gadījumā līniju neatmaksājas būvēt, jo tā sanāk
pārāk dārga.

0:11:21.140,0:11:24.000
Tāpēc ideja, ka "Mums šeit ir viena vēja stacija,
šeit ir viena saules stacija,

0:11:24.000,0:11:27.440
un tur ir vēl viena vēja stacija, un kāda no 
šīm trijām vienmēr strādās."

0:11:27.440,0:11:31.500
Bet mums uz tām visām ir jāievelk pārvades
līnijas.

0:11:31.500,0:11:34.750
Un tas nav praktiski iespējams. Cilvēki, kas to piedāvā,
nav palūkojušies uz skaitļiem.

0:11:34.750,0:11:37.580
Cilvēki nevēlas redzēt spēkstacijas un pārvades līnijas.
Viņi ar nagiem un zobiem cīnās pret

0:11:37.580,0:11:42.300
pārvades līnijām savā pagalmā.
Ja mēs vēlamies uzticamu enerģijas avotu,

0:11:42.300,0:11:45.260
tad tam ir jābūt tuvu vietai, kur to patērē.

0:11:45.260,0:11:47.310
Es zinu, kā tu varētu piepulcināt vairāk sievietes.

0:11:47.310,0:11:47.780
Jā.

0:11:47.780,0:11:48.760
Dodies pie Opras (Oprah Winfrey).

0:11:48.760,0:11:52.720
Kā gan es varētu iekļūt viņas klubā?

0:11:52.720,0:11:57.850
Daudzi no mums ir mums ir apguvuši kodolfiziku
un ap to saistīto politiku.

0:11:57.850,0:11:59.530
Paldies, ka mums šodien pievienojies.

0:11:59.530,0:12:01.380
Liels paldies! Man prieks, ka tu esi šeit.  

0:12:01.380,0:12:03.010
Sveiki, zēni, jūs esat diezgan tehniska grupa?

0:12:03.010,0:12:06.240
Daži no jums runāja par to, kas ir urķēšanās.
Bet ir arī tāda lieta, kā

0:12:06.240,0:12:07.190
kodolurķēšana.

0:12:07.190,0:12:12.600
Es esmu ļoti priecīgs, ka jūs šodien esat šeit
un piedalieties šajā diskusijā.

0:12:12.600,0:12:16.280
Atbilde ir enerģija, kas ir lētāka par ogļu enerģiju.

0:12:16.280,0:12:21.030
Par visām lietām, kuras ir cēlušas mūsu labklājību,
mums ir jāpateicas enerģijai.

0:12:21.030,0:12:26.380
Ja pieņemam, ka vēlamies pasliktināt 160 miljonu cilvēku
dzīves,

0:12:26.380,0:12:31.890
ko izsauks jūras līmeņa celšanās, klimata izmaiņas, u.t.t.,
tad sākot ar 2011. gada janvāri, mums ir jāsamazina

0:12:31.890,0:12:34.520
CO2 izmeši par 4% gadā... 

0:12:34.520,0:12:40.630
Vai mēs to darām?

0:12:40.630,0:12:47.630
Kad man bija divi gadi un 10 mēneši, es pirmo reizi
redzēju Zvaigžņu karus. Tās ir manas senākās atmiņas.

0:12:51.820,0:12:56.520
Mans tētis man neticēja, ka es patiešām atceros
līdz es sāku stāstīt par

0:12:56.520,0:12:59.700
tās dienas notikumiem. Viņš teica, ka pēc tās reizes,
viss, par ko es varēju runāt, bija kosmoss.

0:12:59.700,0:13:04.770
10 gadus es strādāju NASA. Sākumā, ap 2000 gadu
es nodarbojos ar Mēness bāzi.

0:13:04.770,0:13:09.350
Tai bija visas tās pašas vajadzības, kas nepieciešamas
kopienai uz Zemes,

0:13:09.350,0:13:15.480
bet tai bija arī daudzi unikāli ierobežojumi.
Uz mēness nav ne naftas, ne akmeņogļu,

0:13:15.480,0:13:20.630
ne dabasgāzes, ne arī atmosfēras un vēja.
Mēness apriņķo Zemi mēneša laikā un

0:13:20.630,0:13:25.030
katras divas nedēļas Saule noriet un saules baterijas
neražo strāvu.

0:13:25.030,0:13:28.530
Ja vēlaties saglabāt enerģiju divām nedēļām baterijās,
tas vienkārši ir

0:13:28.530,0:13:29.060
ekonomiski neizdevīgi.

0:13:29.060,0:13:34.400
Es domāju, ka kodolenerģija nav nekas sevišķs.
Es par to domāju tā: "Ē, vecas lietas,

0:13:34.400,0:13:37.120
kas gan ar tām vēlas krāmēties?" Bet tad es
uzzināju, ka tās var padarīt daudz efektīvākas

0:13:37.120,0:13:39.910
un sāku par tām nopietni interesēties.

0:13:39.910,0:13:43.590
Es aizgāju pie viena kolēģa, un viņš no plaukta
paņēma grāmatu, kas saucās:

0:13:43.590,0:13:47.090
"Šķidrās degvielas reaktori" viņš bija strādājis
Oukridžas Nacionālajā laboratorijā Tenesijā

0:13:47.090,0:13:51.900
un viņš teica "Jā, savā laikā mēs nodarbojāmies ar
dažādām lietām Oukridžā", un turpināja 

0:13:51.900,0:13:57.440
"Es aizgāju uz bibliotēku un dabūju šo grāmatu."
Tā bija sarakstīta 1958. gadā un viņš teica

0:13:57.440,0:14:01.350
"Biju domājis to izskatīt. Es nedaudz par to zinu,
lai gan neko daudz."

0:14:01.350,0:14:06.080
Tā es paņēmu grāmatu uz mājām, tā bija apmēram 1000
lapu bieza, un izmisīgi pūlējos

0:14:06.080,0:14:10.080
saprast kodolfizikas jēdzienus tajā. Bet tomēr grāmata
bija intriģējoša un aprakstītās tehnoloģijas

0:14:10.080,0:14:15.150
bija stipri savādāka no tām, kuras mēs bijām pieraduši redzēt.

0:14:15.150,0:14:18.860
Grāmatā ļoti bieži tika pieminēts torijs.
Torijs, torijs, torijs. Un es pie sevis domāju:

0:14:18.860,0:14:20.680
"Kas pie velna ir torijs?"

0:14:20.680,0:14:24.820
Bet es biju ieintriģēts un sāku meklēt visu iespējamo
informāciju par toriju. Es meklēju

0:14:24.820,0:14:27.450
tiešsaistes materiālus un uzgāju Rodu Adamsu (Rod Adams).

0:14:27.450,0:14:31.460
ASV nodokļu maksātāji nosūtīja mani uz zemūdenēm.
Es dzīvoju vidē, kuru 100% nodrošināja

0:14:31.460,0:14:36.810
kodolenerģija. Un cilvēki par to parasti nezina.

0:14:36.810,0:14:42.240
Ilgi pirms tam neviens uz visas pasaules nezināja,
ka ir iespējams nodrošināt pastāvīgu ķēdes reakciju,

0:14:42.240,0:14:48.170
līdz 1938. gadā daži cilvēki atklāja, ka kaut kas tāds ir 
iespējams

0:14:48.170,0:14:49.330
un var iegūt kodolenerģiju.

0:14:49.330,0:14:54.820
Tagad ar šķidra torija fluorīda reaktoriem
var iegūt enerģiju ar ļoti mazu radioktīvo atkritumu daudzumu

0:14:54.820,0:14:59.910
un tos var izmantot ar, lai izmantotu jau uzkrātos
radioaktīvos atkritumus. Līdz ar to, vai valdība

0:14:59.910,0:15:01.880
var darīt ko vairāk lai atbalstītu šo tehnoloģiju?

0:15:01.880,0:15:06.780
Īstenība ir tāda, ka mums ir radioaktīvie atkritumi,
bet tā par tiem nedomā.

0:15:06.780,0:15:11.800
Lūdzu piedodiet manu nezināšanu, bet kas ir torijs?

0:15:11.800,0:15:17.190
Ja mans pirmā līmeņa zinātnes skolotājs tagad 
mani redzētu. Vārds ir cēlies no Norvēģu dieva Tora

0:15:17.190,0:15:22.230
un es pieņemu, ka baronesei būs interesanti zināt,
ka tas ir dimorfisks un ir vēl daudzi citi fakti,

0:15:22.230,0:15:29.230
ko jūs varat atrast vikipēdijā, kā to patiesībā
izdarīju arī es.

0:15:30.050,0:15:33.700
Kungi, kungi... kungi.

0:15:33.700,0:15:40.540
Enerģētikas departaments ir norādījis uz manu 
tīmekļa vietni, kā vienīgo tehnisko resursu

0:15:40.540,0:15:45.350
kad tie publicēja informāciju par 4. paaudzes
sāļu reaktoriem. Cilvēki saka

0:15:45.350,0:15:51.240
Ka tas ir liels gods, bet patiesībā tas ir ļoti
bēdīgi, jo es esmu Džo, kas savā garāžā veido

0:15:51.240,0:15:55.420
savu tīmekļa vietni, un tā ir vienīgais pieejamais resurss
uz kuru viņi varēja norādīt?

0:15:55.420,0:15:59.890
Vai administrācija apjauš visas iespējas?
Nē. Vai kāds patiesībā saprot, ka

0:15:59.890,0:16:06.890
kodolenerģija ir civilizāciju mainoša tehnoloģija?

0:16:07.810,0:16:11.920
Es redzu, ka daži no jums sāk smaidīt, kad
tiek pieminēts šķidra torija fluorīda reaktors,

0:16:11.920,0:16:15.750
un tas mani nedaudz satrauc. Ko jūs dzirdat
par izkausēta sāls reaktoriem?

0:16:15.750,0:16:18.330
Vai esat kaut ko dzirdējuši par izkausēta sāls reaktoriem?

0:16:18.330,0:16:23.640
Es būtu pārsteigts, ja mūsu valdība būtu kaut ko dzirdējusi 
par tiem. Nedomāju, ka viņi lasa emuārus.

0:16:23.640,0:16:27.880
Tas, ka mums tagad ir Internets, līdzšinējās lietas mainīs.

0:16:27.880,0:16:32.310
Mums bija bronzas laikmets un dzelzs laikmets
un mums bija Industriālā revolūcija.

0:16:32.310,0:16:36.010
Es patiešām domāju, ka 100 gadus vēlāk teiks,
ka mēs uzsākām Torija laikmetu.

0:16:36.010,0:16:39.550
Es jums pastāstīšu, kā tas sākās.
Bija tāds Glenns Sīborgs (Glenn Seaborg), kurš

0:16:39.550,0:16:46.000
1942. g. strādāja Bērklijā, Kalifornijā.
Un viņš atklāja plutoniju.

0:16:46.000,0:16:52.200
Un viņš domāja: "Varbūt mēs varam ar plutonija
neitronu apstarot toriju,

0:16:52.200,0:16:54.560
un skatīties, vai tas pārvēršas." Jums jāatceras, ka kodolu
dalīšanās tika atklāta tikai trīs gadus agrāk,

0:16:54.560,0:16:55.950
un tas vēl arvien bija pats sākums.

0:16:55.950,0:16:58.720
Viņam bija viens students. Katrs, kas ir bijis
students zina, kā izskatās,

0:16:58.720,0:17:02.190
kad profesors saka:"Tā. Es vēlos, lai tu aizej
uz kodolfizikas laboratoriju un ieslēdz neitronu

0:17:02.190,0:17:07.740
lielgabalu un apstaro šo radioaktīvo paraugu,

0:17:07.740,0:17:09.449
un apskaties, kas notiks."

0:17:09.449,0:17:13.079
"Tā kā tagad ir karš, ser, es varētu būt arī
cīnīties frontē, vai ne ser?"

0:17:13.079,0:17:13.589
"Jā, tu varētu būt."

0:17:13.589,0:17:15.529
"Labi, ser. Es došos uz laboratoriju."

0:17:15.529,0:17:20.110
Students aizgāja uz laboratoriju un veica eksperimentu.
Un devās atpakaļ pie Sīborga un teica:

0:17:20.110,0:17:25.019
"Eksperiments izdevās. Sanāca kaut kas jauns.
Torijs absorbēja neitronu,

0:17:25.019,0:17:28.279
un kļuva par urānu-233. Vai tas nav forši?"

0:17:28.279,0:17:32.860
Sīborgs atbildēja: "Jā patiešām. Un tagad iesim soli tālāk,
mans nabaga student!

0:17:32.860,0:17:37.830
Es vēlos, lai tu atkal apstaro to ar neitroniem, un pārbaudi,
vai tas sadalīsies.

0:17:37.830,0:17:40.309
Jo es domāju, ka tas sadalīsies, tieši tāpat,
kā sadalās urāns-235."

0:17:40.309,0:17:41.840
"Labi, ser."

0:17:41.840,0:17:46.409
Students aiziet uz laboratoriju, nāk atpakaļ un saka:
"Jā, jums bija taisnība. Tas sadalījās.

0:17:46.409,0:17:49.960
Tas ir jauns kodolenerģijas veids."

0:17:49.960,0:17:55.090
Un tad Sīborgs uzdeva patiesi svarīgu jautājumu. Viņš teica:
"Tagad dodies un uzzini,

0:17:55.090,0:18:02.090
cik daudz neitronu rodas, kad tas sabruka.
Jo, ja to skaits ir mazāks par 2,

0:18:02.470,0:18:07.720
piemēram, 1,5 vai tamlīdzīgi, tad
tas nav nekāds notikums,

0:18:07.720,0:18:13.899
tikai interesents fakts grāmatā,
bet, ja to skaits ir lielāks par 2,

0:18:13.899,0:18:14.580
tad tas jau ir nopietni."

0:18:14.580,0:18:19.850
Students atnāk atpakaļ un saka: "Ser, neitronu skaits ir
2,5."

0:18:19.850,0:18:25.289
Sīborgs raugās uz studentu (ir 1942. gada decembris)
un saka: "Tu tagad veici

0:18:25.289,0:18:28.279
50 kvadriljonu dolāru vērtu atklājumu."

0:18:28.279,0:18:32.860
Un students atbildēja ko līdzīgu: "Uhh!"

0:18:32.860,0:18:39.860
Sīborgam bija absolūta taisnība. Viņš bija atklājis,
ka torijs var kalpot par praktiski neizsmeļamu

0:18:40.159,0:18:47.029
kodoldegvielas avotu. Un viņš zināja, ka torijs uz Zemes
ir ļoti izplatīts elements.

0:18:47.029,0:18:53.100
Un viņš saprata, ka šajā procesā, ja jums ir nedaudz 
urāna-233, jūs varat to izmantot kā katalizatoru 

0:18:53.100,0:18:56.549
ar kuru varat bezgalīgi "dedzināt" toriju.

0:18:56.549,0:19:01.690
Patiesībā jūs sadalāt urānu-233, bet tajā pat laikā
radiet to arī no jauna. Tāpēc tas nav katalizators

0:19:01.690,0:19:06.580
ķīmisko reakciju izpratnē, kurā katalizators netiek 
patērēts, bet jūs pilnībā varat to uzskatīt

0:19:06.580,0:19:08.950
par pseido-katalizatoru.

0:19:08.950,0:19:12.830
Tagad parunāsim par to, kas ir kodolu dalīšanās.

0:19:12.830,0:19:17.820
Jums ir dalītiesspējīgs kodols. Tātad, tas ir atoma kodols.
Ja jūs apstarojat to ar neitronu,

0:19:17.820,0:19:23.250
tad tas parasti sadalās divās daļās, 
un kas vēl ir svarīgi,

0:19:23.250,0:19:28.059
tas izstaro arī 2-3 papildu neitronus

0:19:28.059,0:19:33.740
Kāpēc tas mums ir svarīgi?

0:19:33.740,0:19:40.529
Tāpēc, ka ar katru kilogramu dalītiesspējīga materiāla,
mēs varam iegūt enerģiju, kas salīdzināma ar

0:19:40.529,0:19:47.490
13000 bareliem naftas. Kodolu dalīšanās enerģijas blīvums
ir miljoniem reižu lielāks nekā ķīmiskai reakcijai.

0:19:47.490,0:19:52.320
Civilizācija ir veikusi milzīgus tehnoloģiskus sasniegumus

0:19:52.320,0:19:52.990
ar daudz mazākām enerģijas iespējām.

0:19:52.990,0:19:57.320
Kad jūs sašķeļat kādu kodolu divās daļās,
tās ir radioaktīvas.

0:19:57.320,0:19:58.419
Kāpēc tās ir radioaktīvas?

0:19:58.419,0:20:03.929
Šī diagramma parāda dabā sastopamo vielu atomu
protonu un neitronu attiecību. 

0:20:03.929,0:20:09.470
Ja visu izotopu protonu un neitronu attiecība visiem būtu vienāda,

0:20:09.470,0:20:12.100
grafikā būtu viena taisna līnija.

0:20:12.100,0:20:16.840
Bet tā nav. Sākumā protonu un neitronu
attiecība ir aptuveni vienāda,

0:20:16.840,0:20:21.399
Bet, kodoliem paliekot lielākiem, neitronu attiecība
paliek arvien lielāka.

0:20:21.399,0:20:26.429
Melnie punkti norāda stabilos kodolus, kas nav radiokatīvi.

0:20:26.429,0:20:31.360
Protoni ir pozitīvi lādēti un elektriskais lauks kodolus cenšas saraut,

0:20:31.360,0:20:35.090
bet kodolu stiprā mijiedarbība satur kodolus kopā.

0:20:35.090,0:20:40.289
Arvien vairāk neitronu nodrošina vairāk
kodolu stiprās mijiedarbības "līmi"

0:20:40.289,0:20:43.379
tāpēc kodoli nesašķīst.

0:20:43.379,0:20:49.480
Šeit lejā ir urāns un torijs. Un tiem ir neitronu ir aptuveni
divas reizes vairāk

0:20:49.480,0:20:54.850
nekā protonu. Ja šādu kodolu sadalāt divās
daļās, tām abām ir aptuveni tāda pati attiecība,

0:20:54.850,0:21:00.110
bet šiem kodoliem tāda nav vajadzīga. Tiem vajag 
attiecību kas ir tuvāka

0:21:00.110,0:21:02.059
viens pret viens un viena ceturtdaļa.

0:21:02.059,0:21:05.620
Tiem ir par daudz neitronu. Dabā pastāv dažādi veidi,
kā ar to tikt galā.

0:21:05.620,0:21:09.659
Viens no tiem ir beta sabrukšana. Tajā neitrons pārvēršas
par protonu un kodols izstaro elektronu.

0:21:09.659,0:21:14.159
Tāpēc, kodolu dalīšanās procesā rodas kodoli, kas ir radioaktīvi.

0:21:14.159,0:21:18.759
Lai arī kodolu dalīšanās sākumā protonu un neitronu attiecība kodolā bija pareiza,

0:21:18.759,0:21:20.440
reakcijas beigās tā kļuva nepareiza.

0:21:20.440,0:21:26.590
Šeit ir parādīta kodolu dalīšanās produktu masas
sadalījums ar diviem maksimumiem.

0:21:26.590,0:21:30.990
Šī ir mazākā bijušā kodola daļa un šī ir lielākā daļa,

0:21:30.990,0:21:35.620
jo parasti tie nesadalās tieši uz pusēm. Tā kā tie ir pārbagāti
ar neitroniem,

0:21:35.620,0:21:38.240
tiem ir jāatbrīvojas no tiem, lai kļūtu par stabiliem kodoliem.

0:21:38.240,0:21:42.879
Tagad parunāsim par radioaktivitāti. Arī man 
kādreiz bija nepareiza izpratne par to.

0:21:42.879,0:21:46.710
Es domāju, ka, ja vienam elementam pussabrukšanas laiks ir diena,

0:21:46.710,0:21:51.090
bet otram — miljoni gadu, tad man šķita, 

0:21:51.090,0:21:55.970
tas, kas ir radiokatīvs vienu dienu, tas saka "tr" un pēc dienas 
hop, un "Es esmu stabils". Bet tas,

0:21:55.970,0:21:59.700
kas ir radioaktīvs miljons gadus, tas saka "brrrrrrrrr"
miljons gadus līdz paliek stabils.

0:21:59.700,0:22:00.419
Tā.

0:22:00.419,0:22:04.649
Kā jūs domājat, kurš no tiem ir bīstamāks?
Protams, ka parasti šķiet,

0:22:04.649,0:22:08.649
ka bīstamāks ir tas, kas ir radioaktīvs bezmaz mūžīgi,

0:22:08.649,0:22:11.509
bet tas, kas tikai vienu dienu, tas ir nekaitīgs. Vai ne?

0:22:11.509,0:22:17.340
Patiesībā ir tieši otrādi. Tas, kas ir radioaktīvs
vienu dienu, tas ir ļoti, ļoti, ļoti radioaktīvs.

0:22:17.340,0:22:23.370
Tas, kas ir radioaktīvs miljons gadus, praktiski nav radioaktīvs.

0:22:23.370,0:22:27.649
Kurš no abiem ir bīstamāks? Patiesi bīstams ir tas,

0:22:27.649,0:22:29.480
kurš ir radioaktīvs tikai vienu dienu.

0:22:29.480,0:22:35.870
Radioaktivitāte ir apgriezti proporcionāla
kodola pussabrukšanas laikam. 

0:22:35.870,0:22:40.289
Šie sadalīšanās produkti ir ļoti, ļoti bīstami,
bet tie pazūd ļoti ātri.

0:22:40.289,0:22:45.580
Šis, kas dzīvo 2,3 miljonus gadu, nesagādā nekādas problēmas.
Tas jums nekaitēs,

0:22:45.580,0:22:47.240
jo tas nav pietiekami radioaktīvs.

0:22:47.240,0:22:51.409
Kā ir ar toriju un urānu? Abi ir dabā sastopami
elementi. Torijam ir tikai

0:22:51.409,0:22:57.909
viens izotops – torijs-232. Tā pussabrukšanas laiks ir
14 miljardi gadu. Tad, kad visums

0:22:57.909,0:23:02.039
būs divreiz vecāks kā tagad, tikai puse no visa torija būs 
sabrukusi.

0:23:02.039,0:23:06.330
Cik radioaktīvs tad ir torijs?

0:23:06.330,0:23:12.350
Tas ir praktiski stabils. Un tāpēc tā vēl arvien ir tik daudz.
Urānam ir divi dābā sastopami izotopi: urāns-235 un urāns-238.

0:23:12.350,0:23:16.379
Abi, protams, ir radioaktīvi. Urāna-238 pussabrukšanas laiks ir
5 miljardi gadu, un tas, kas atrodams uz Zemes,

0:23:16.379,0:23:19.899
ir aptuveni Zemes vecumā.

0:23:19.899,0:23:24.019
Urāna-235 dzīves laiks ir daudz īsāks,
tas pussabrūk 700 miljonu gadu laikā.

0:23:24.019,0:23:27.240
Cik izplatīts tas ir uz zemes? Vairums zemes sastāv
no skābekļa.

0:23:27.240,0:23:32.499
Vai tas nav jocīgi?. 46% no Zemes ir skābeklis, jo 
gandrīz viss ir oksidējies.

0:23:32.499,0:23:35.879
Visas klintis: silīcijs, alumīnijs, dzelzs, kalcijs,
un daudz kas cits.

0:23:35.879,0:23:40.759
Torijs no tā visa ir 10 daļas no miljona.
Bet ir daudzi elementi, kas ir retāki par to.

0:23:40.759,0:23:45.740
Berilijs, alva, volframs. Šeit ir 
urāns — divas ar pusi daļas no miljona.

0:23:45.740,0:23:50.960
Volframs, alumīnijs, dzīvsudrabs, sudrabs,
un kur ir zelts? Nav nekāds pārsteigums,

0:23:50.960,0:23:52.710
ka sievietes to vēlas.

0:23:52.710,0:23:58.070
Tagad apskatīsim, kur būtu urāns-235, ja to izdalītu
kā atsevišķu elementu.

0:23:58.070,0:24:03.350
Tā ir mazāk par procentu no visa urāna —
aptuveni 0,7% no visa urāna. Jūs redzat, ka

0:24:03.350,0:24:07.450
urāns-235 ir tikpat rets kā sudrabs un platīns.

0:24:07.450,0:24:12.889
Vai varat iedomāties, ka platīnu dedzinātu, lai iegūtu enerģiju?
Tas būtu trakums. Bet patiesībā

0:24:12.889,0:24:18.039
mūsdienu kodolenerģētika dara tieši to.
Mēs dedzinām šo izcili reto un dārgo vielu,

0:24:18.039,0:24:25.009
bet neizmantojam daudz izplatītāko urānu-238
un toriju.

0:24:25.009,0:24:27.539
Tos mēs atstājam neizmantotus.

0:24:27.539,0:24:32.570
Daži cilvēki, kas uztraucas par dabu saka:
"Kodolenerģētika nav ilgtspējīga.

0:24:32.570,0:24:36.940
Mums pietrūks urāna."
Es parasti atbildu: "Es piekrītu, ja tā domā

0:24:36.940,0:24:41.950
par šodienas kodolenerģētiku. Bet, ja mēs domājam

0:24:41.950,0:24:45.840
par citām kodolenerģijas iespējām, tad tas tā nav."

0:24:45.840,0:24:51.559
Torijs viens pats nav izmantojams, lai iegūtu kodolenerģiju.
Bet, ja jūs iesitat torijam ar neitronu,

0:24:51.559,0:24:55.669
tad torijs to absorbē, un kļūst no torija-232

0:24:55.669,0:25:02.249
par toriju-233. Torija-233 pusdzīves ilgums ir tikai
20 minūtes. Vai tas ir radioaktīvs?

0:25:02.249,0:25:08.730
O, jā. Tas ir trakoti radioaktīvs un ļoti, ļoti, ļoti kaitīgs.
Dažu minūšu laikā tas sabrūk par protaktīniju-233,

0:25:08.730,0:25:10.559
kura pusdzīves laiks ir aptuveni mēnesis.

0:25:10.559,0:25:14.379
Tāpēc arī šis ir diezgan kaitīgs, un jūs visticamāk
nevēlētos ar to spēlēties.

0:25:14.379,0:25:18.879
Nedaudz ilgāk kā mēneša laikā tas sabrūk par urānu-233, kura
pussabrukšanas laiks ir aptuveni, 160000 gadu,

0:25:18.879,0:25:22.200
tātad tas ir daudz mazāk radioaktīvs.

0:25:22.200,0:25:27.409
Ja urānam-233 iesit ar neitronu,
tad tas sabrūk. Un papildus izdalītajai enerģijai,

0:25:27.409,0:25:32.700
tas izstaro arī divus vai trīs neitronus. Jums
ir nepieciešami šie neitroni,

0:25:32.700,0:25:37.559
lai ar vienu no tiem apstarotu kādu citu torija kodolu,

0:25:37.559,0:25:41.169
bet ar otru – urānu-233, lai uzturētu dalīšanās reakciju.

0:25:41.169,0:25:47.759
Dažiem no šiem sadalīšanās produktiem ir milzīga
vēlme "apēst" neitronus.

0:25:47.759,0:25:53.009
Zinātnieki šo īpašību raksturo ar t.s. neitronu
satveršanas laukumu. Tas norāda, cik liela ir 

0:25:53.009,0:25:58.759
varbūtība, ka kodols notvers neitronu. Viens no šādiem
elementiem ir Ksenons-135. Te ir tā satveršanas laukums,  

0:25:58.759,0:26:04.590
salīdzinot ar citiem elementiem.
Vai redzat šos mazos aplīšus? 

0:26:04.590,0:26:07.960
Iedomājieties, ka mēs spēlējam dartus.
Kurā no tiem ir visvieglāk trāpīt?

0:26:07.960,0:26:14.090
Kodolu dalīšanās procesā rodas arī Ksenons-135.
Kur tas ir?

0:26:14.090,0:26:21.090
135 ir šeit. Pastāv varbūtība, ka procesā izveidosies arī
šis elements.

0:26:24.769,0:26:29.999
Ksenona-135 pusdzīves laiks ir deviņas stundas. Tas ir
ļoti radioaktīvs, bet šo stundu laikā

0:26:29.999,0:26:30.940
tas ļoti vēlas "apēst" jūsu neitronu.

0:26:30.940,0:26:31.190
Esošajos reaktoros tas rada nopietnas grūtības.
Jo ksenons darbojas pretī tam, ko jūs vēlaties.

0:26:31.169,0:26:32.879
Patiesībā Ksenons-135 bija pie vainas

0:26:32.879,0:26:39.289
Černobiļas katastrofā. Un reaktoros

0:26:39.289,0:26:45.580
ar cietu kodoldegvielu tas ir īpaši sarežģīti.
Patiesībā ksenons traucē visos reaktoros,

0:26:45.580,0:26:50.499
sākot no paša pirmā. Šis ir Henfordas reaktors
Vašingtonā. To uzbūvēja Manhetenas projekta laikā.

0:26:50.499,0:26:54.360
Lai izstrādātu plutoniju kodolieročiem.

0:26:54.360,0:26:58.740
Kad to uzbūvēja, sākumā viss gāja normāli,
bet pēc vairākām stundām darba,

0:26:58.740,0:27:05.340
reaktora jauda pēkšņi kritās gandrīz
līdz nullei.

0:27:05.340,0:27:09.480
Visi brīnījās: "Kas, ellē, notiek?"
Tomēr nolēma to atstāt mierā.

0:27:09.480,0:27:15.970
Un pēc kādām 12-18 stundām, reaktors pats atsāka
strādāt.

0:27:15.970,0:27:21.100
Un, kamēr visi brīnījās, kas notiek, pēc vairākām stundām
jauda atkal kritās.

0:27:21.100,0:27:25.139
"Tas ir ārprāts, mēs neko nedarām,
bet reaktors pats slēdz sevi

0:27:25.139,0:27:27.399
iekšā un ārā." 

0:27:27.399,0:27:33.929
Patiesībā notika tas, ka reaktoram darbojoties,
tajā uzkrājās ksenons-135.

0:27:33.929,0:27:37.769
Kad tas sakrājās pietiekami daudz, tas apēda
arvien vairāk neitronu.

0:27:37.769,0:27:41.110
To vairs nebija pietiekami daudz un reakcija apstājās.

0:27:41.110,0:27:44.869
Kad tas sabruka, [augšupejošs svilpiens]

0:27:44.869,0:27:50.330
un reaktors atsāka strādāt.

0:27:50.330,0:27:53.320
Tajā laikā viņi pat nezināja, kas ir ksenons-135,

0:27:53.320,0:27:58.720
jo tas bija pasaulē pirmais reaktors.
Mums par laimi, bija tāds

0:27:58.720,0:28:00.789
Eižens Vīners.

0:28:00.789,0:28:02.399
Neticami gudrs, iespējams viens no pasaules gudrākajiem
prātiem, kas ieguvis Nobeļa prēmiju.

0:28:02.399,0:28:05.110
Viņš pirms gulēšanas domāja par to
"Cik tālu ar kodlreaktoru ir vācieši?"

0:28:05.110,0:28:08.529
Viņš vienmēr par domāja par to.

0:28:08.529,0:28:08.830
Un viņš domāja par to:

0:28:08.830,0:28:13.139
"Kas slikts varētu notikt ar manu reaktoru?"

0:28:13.139,0:28:18.639
Un viņš izdomāja, ka reaktorā varētu rasties
kaut kas tāds, kas labi absorbē neitronus.

0:28:18.639,0:28:24.559
"Un, ja tas sabrūk pietiekami ātri,

0:28:24.559,0:28:26.220
tad tas varētu likt reaktoram darboties ... tieši tā!"

0:28:26.220,0:28:32.249
Viņš pat nezināja, kas tas īsti bija,
bet izsecināja, ka kaut kas tāds varētu pastāvēt.

0:28:32.249,0:28:36.149
Un kad viņa reaktors sāka tā uzvesties,
viņš saprata, kā ar to cīnīties.

0:28:36.149,0:28:40.980
Reaktorā bija vairākas brīvas vietas un viņi
tajā salika papildu degvielas stieņus,

0:28:40.980,0:28:44.789
lai kompensētu šo efektu. Līdz ar to viņi

0:28:44.789,0:28:48.980
varēja pabeigt Manhetenas projektu. Un ieguva plutoniju

0:28:48.980,0:28:50.820
no kura izgatavoja pasaules pirmo kodolbumbu.

0:28:50.820,0:28:55.610
Viņi ņēma dabīgo urānu, un sadalīja to izotopos,
lai iegūtu lielāku urāna-235 koncentrāciju.

0:28:55.610,0:29:02.460
Viņi palielināja tā koncentrāciju no mazāk par
vienu procenta līdz vairāk par 90%.

0:29:02.460,0:29:07.989
Un tas nav viegli. Lai veiktu izotopu atdalīšanu,
nepieciešamas lielas rūpnīcas.

0:29:07.989,0:29:12.720
Bet pirmajai atombumbai urānu ieguva tieši tā.

0:29:12.720,0:29:16.529
To bumbu nometa uz Hirosimas un nosauca par
"mazo puisēnu". To nemēģināja, jo zināja,

0:29:16.529,0:29:17.499
ka tā strādās.

0:29:17.499,0:29:22.850
Un viņi domāja, "ko gan mēs varētu darīt ar atlikušajiem
99,3% urāna-238?"

0:29:22.850,0:29:27.299
Sīborgs izdomāja, ka to varētu apstarot ar neitroniem,

0:29:27.299,0:29:29.649
un iegūt no tā plutoniju.

0:29:29.649,0:29:35.239
Pēc neilga laika vēl arvien stipri radioaktīvos
stieņus nogādāja uz

0:29:35.239,0:29:38.119
T-staciju Henfordas 200 apgabalā.

0:29:38.119,0:29:43.669
Plutonijs ir savādāks ķīmiskais elements nekā urāns,
tāpēc tos var atdalīt ķīmiskā veidā.

0:29:43.669,0:29:49.929
Šajā procesā viņi ieguva niecīgu plutonija daudzumu,
kas, rēķinot uz masas vienību, bija dārgākais

0:29:49.929,0:29:50.659
elements pasaulē.

0:29:50.659,0:29:56.789
Bet atdalīt vienu no otra ķīmiskos elementus ir
miljoniem reižu vienkāršāk, nekā viena elementa izotopus.

0:29:56.789,0:29:57.929
Ķīmiski urāns-235 un urān-238 ir vienādi.
Starp tiem nav nekādu ķīmisku atšķirību.

0:29:57.929,0:29:59.019
Bet plutonijs un urāns atšķiras ķīmiski.

0:29:59.019,0:30:02.580
un tāpēc tos var atdalīt vienu no otra ķīmiskā ceļā.

0:30:02.580,0:30:07.440
Un tā viņi radīja pirmo plutonija bumbu, Triniti,
kuru uzspridzināja Meksikā,

0:30:07.440,0:30:11.730
arī "Resno zēnu", kuru nometa Nagasaki.

0:30:11.730,0:30:15.759
Sīborgs domāja par to, ka to pašu varētu darīt,
arī izmantojot toriju. Piemēram, apstarot to ar neitroniem,

0:30:15.759,0:30:22.279
un pārvērst to urānā-233. Urānu arī var atdalīt no torija
ķīmiskā procesā, un izgatavot no tā bumbu.

0:30:22.279,0:30:23.649
Izklausās labi.

0:30:23.649,0:30:28.489
Viņi sāka šo iespēju pētīt, un atklājās, ka tā tomēr ir
slikta ideja.

0:30:28.489,0:30:34.489
Jo atklājās, ka, izmantojot urānu-233, vienmēr iegūst arī
urānu-232. Šeit sabrukšanas ķēdē ir urāns-232.

0:30:34.489,0:30:41.489
Tas pārvēršas par citiem elementiem gada laikā,
trijās dienās, 55 sekundēs, 0.16 sekundēs,

0:30:42.619,0:30:49.440
un beigās pārvēršas par bismutu-212 un talliju-208,
bet šie divi elementi izstaro

0:30:49.440,0:30:50.879
spēcīgus gamma starus.

0:30:50.879,0:30:56.850
Bet gamma stari ir ļoti nevēlami, ja vēlaties izveidot
praktisku kodolieroci.

0:30:56.850,0:31:01.119
Jo pirmkārt, tas nogalina visus,

0:31:01.119,0:31:04.649
kas ar to strādā, un otrkārt, ar gamma staru detektoriem

0:31:04.649,0:31:05.830
var ātri atklāt, kur atrodas šāda bumba.

0:31:05.830,0:31:10.259
Līdz ar to, viņi ātri saprata, ka var izmantot urānu-235,

0:31:10.259,0:31:15.929
var izmantot plutoniju, bet urāns-233 neder

0:31:15.929,0:31:17.739
lai to izmantotu kodolieročos.

0:31:17.739,0:31:23.389
Tāpēc kara laikā torijs tika nolikts malā.

0:31:23.389,0:31:26.629
Pēc kara viņi atsāka domāt par to, kā

0:31:26.629,0:31:32.549
"ieroču vietā radīt enerģiju".
Šajā grafikā parādīta dažādu elementu neitronu absorbēšana

0:31:32.549,0:31:36.369
atkarībā no neitronu enerģijas.

0:31:36.369,0:31:40.830
Šie ir t.s. termālie neitroni, kas atdevuši savu enerģiju siltumā.

0:31:40.830,0:31:45.619
Šie ir t.s. ātrie neitroni, kas tikko izlidojuši no kodola un ir ļoti ātri.
Skatieties,

0:31:45.619,0:31:50.070
cik daudz reizes lielāks ir šķērsgriezums, ja neitroni ir lēni.

0:31:50.070,0:31:55.039
Šeit lejā ir parādīti ātro neitronu ķeršanas laukumi ×25.
Tā kā šajā rindā tie ir knapi saskatāmi,

0:31:55.039,0:32:01.389
Šeit tie ir parādīti 25 reizes lielāki.
Jūs redzat, cik liela ir atšķirība.

0:32:01.389,0:32:05.269
Sarkanā krāsa norāda, ka kodols neitronu tikai absorbē,

0:32:05.269,0:32:08.369
bet zilā krāsa norāda, ka kodols ne tika absorbē neitronu, bet 
arī sadalās.

0:32:08.369,0:32:12.159
Jūs vēlaties zilo krāsu. Zilā krāsa ir laba.

0:32:12.159,0:32:14.739
Jo tad šie kodoli, absorbējot neitronu sadalās.

0:32:14.739,0:32:20.690
Tagad skatieties uz plutoniju. Uh. Liels mērķis, vai ne?
Bet katru trešo reizi tas vienkārši apēd mūsu

0:32:20.690,0:32:26.330
termālo neitronu. Tas gan nav labi. No otras puses,
ar ātrajiem neitroniem tas gandrīz vienmēr

0:32:26.330,0:32:32.700
sadalās. Tomēr cik daudz mums ir jāapvieno šie mazie laukumiņi,

0:32:32.700,0:32:37.499
lai iegūtu vienu lielo. Mums tādu vajag

0:32:37.499,0:32:38.429
ļoti daudz.

0:32:38.429,0:32:45.119
Cik daudz neitronu un cik daudz kodoldegvielas
ir vajadzīgs

0:32:45.119,0:32:50.389
lai nodrošinātu nepārtrauktu kodoldalīšanos?

0:32:50.389,0:32:56.070
Šie mazie punktiņi attiecas uz šo līknes daļu.
Šie ir ātrie neitroni.

0:32:56.070,0:32:59.749
Šie ir termālie neitroni. Kas vislabāk
izskatās termālajā daļā?

0:32:59.749,0:33:06.749
Urāns-233 ap 2.3. Plutonijs ir šeit lejā,
tāpēc jūs nevarat dedzināt urānu-238

0:33:09.169,0:33:14.999
ar termālajiem neitroniem, piemēram, ar ūdeni
dzesētā reaktorā

0:33:14.999,0:33:17.220
vai CANDU reaktorā.

0:33:17.220,0:33:23.129
Reaktorā ar termālajiem neitroniem,
tas vienkārši nav iespējams.

0:33:23.129,0:33:26.789
Bet zinātnieki nepadevās:

0:33:26.789,0:33:28.799
"Tad mēs varam izmantot ātros neitronus.
Skatieties, cik labi tas izskatās tad.

0:33:28.799,0:33:33.609
Ar ātrajiem neitroniem, tas ir 2-3 reizes lielāks!

0:33:33.609,0:33:39.190
Un tā radās brīdera reaktora ideja

0:33:39.190,0:33:42.320
kas izmanto kā degvielu plutoniju un ātros neitronus.

0:33:42.320,0:33:47.480
Toties urāns-233, lai arī ar ātrajiem neitroniem ir
nedaudz labāks,

0:33:47.480,0:33:50.019
tas vēl arvien ir ļoti labs arī ar lēnajiem neitroniem.

0:33:50.019,0:33:55.779
Tie, kas aizstāvēja toriju teica: "Mums patīk termālie neitroni.

0:33:55.779,0:33:59.710
mēs vēlamies būvēt šādu reaktoru".
Tie, kas aizstāvēja plutoniju teica:

0:33:59.710,0:34:03.019
"Nē, nē, mēs vēlamies ātro neitronu reaktoru. To var darīt
tikai tā".

0:34:03.019,0:34:06.480
Galu galā mēs neizmantojam nevienu no šiem variantiem.
Patiesībā šodienas reaktoros

0:34:06.480,0:34:12.660
mēs dedzinām urānu-235, kas ir tik rets elements,
ka tik pat labi mēs varētu dedzināt platīnu.

0:34:12.660,0:34:17.510
Šādu izvēli mēs neizdarījām apzināti.
Pašā sākumā pastāvēja iespēja izmantot

0:34:17.510,0:34:19.960
gan toriju, gan plutoniju.

0:34:19.960,0:34:25.120
Vīneram neizdevās pārliecināt pārējos kodolpētniekus

0:34:25.120,0:34:30.470
izmantot toriju. Un viņi vienojās izmantot
plutoniju.

0:34:30.470,0:34:35.590
Viens no iemesliem bija tas, ka plutoniju 
pārzināja labāk

0:34:35.590,0:34:40.280
no kodolieroču pētījumiem. Tas bija pieejams
un tā ķīmiskās īpašības bija izpētītas.

0:34:40.280,0:34:46.860
Un no tā ieguva kodoldegvielu. "Mēs pārzinām plutoniju,
bet neko nezinām par toriju.

0:34:46.860,0:34:49.960
Un tāpēc mums viss būtu jāsāk no jauna."

0:34:49.960,0:34:55.000
Šī iemesla dēļ izvēlējās plutoniju

0:34:55.000,0:35:01.080
un nevis toriju. Vīneram neizdevās pārliecināt

0:35:01.080,0:35:06.990
kodolpētnieku komūnu, tomēr viņš pārliecināja
vienu sekotāju — Elvīnu Veinbergu (Alvin Weinberg).

0:35:06.990,0:35:10.000
Veinbergs Manhetenas projekta laikā bija viņa students.

0:35:10.000,0:35:14.650
Veinbergs aptvēra kopējo ainu: "Mums ir nepieciešams
torijs un torija reaktors.

0:35:14.650,0:35:19.500
Un mums vajag šķidru kodoldegvielu." 

0:35:19.500,0:35:25.370
Veinbergs 1955. gadā dabūja vietu Oukridžas nacionālajā laboratorijā,
kad viņam bija 35 gadi.

0:35:25.370,0:35:30.090
Viņš bija jaunāks par mani. Es sēžu un domāju:
"Veinbergs manā vecumā vadīja Oukridžas laboratoriju.

0:35:30.090,0:35:34.200
Ko daru es? Es esmu kaut kādā pagrabā.

0:35:34.200,0:35:35.130
[smiekli]

0:35:35.130,0:35:37.890
Es tika jokoju.

0:35:37.890,0:35:38.810
[smiekli]

0:35:38.810,0:35:43.420
Labi vēl, ka tas nav manas mammas pagrabs.

0:35:43.420,0:35:48.460
Kad viņš nonāca Oukridžā, viņš sev teica:
"Elvīn, tu esi šeit,

0:35:48.460,0:35:53.490
lai tiktu galā ar toriju.
Tas ir svarīgi." 

0:35:53.490,0:35:58.410
Te ir citāts no viņa grāmatas. "Līdz tam
brīdim es pilnībā neaptvēru brīdera nozīmi."

0:35:58.410,0:36:02.330
Un, ar brīderi viņš patiesībā saprata torija reaktoru.

0:36:02.330,0:36:08.750
"Toties tagad es esmu pārliecināts, ka visas cilvēces
nākotne ir ir atkarīga no tā."

0:36:08.750,0:36:14.710
Viņš saprata, ka mums nekas prātīgs nesanāks,

0:36:14.710,0:36:18.180
ja izmantosim urānu-235.

0:36:18.180,0:36:21.290
Kad viņš nonāca Oukridžā, Atomenerģijas komisija

0:36:21.290,0:36:25.210
viņam teica: "Jūsu reaktora bizness ir beidzies.

0:36:25.210,0:36:30.830
Ar to tagad strādā Argonas nacionālā laboratorija
un jums ar to nav jānodarbojas."

0:36:30.830,0:36:35.160
Argonas nacionālā laboratorija strādāja pie plutonija
ātro neitronu brīdera.

0:36:35.160,0:36:37.080
Un visi uzskatīja, ka tas ir īstais ceļš.

0:36:37.080,0:36:42.290
Bet Veinbergs bija izmisis: "Velns ar ārā!
Ko mēs tagad darīsim?"

0:36:42.290,0:36:47.750
Par laimi, interese parādījās Gaisa spēkiem.
"Tā kā Jūras spēkiem ir izstrādāts

0:36:47.750,0:36:52.290
ar ūdeni dzesējams reaktors, mēs vēlamies izpētīt,

0:36:52.290,0:36:57.210
vai ir iespējams izveidot reaktoru bumbvedējam."

0:36:57.210,0:36:58.400
Tas izklausās neprātīgi?

0:36:58.400,0:36:58.800
[smiekli]

0:36:58.800,0:37:00.840
Tas bija galīgi traki.

0:37:00.840,0:37:06.570
Bet Veinbergs bija praktiķis:
"Bumbvedējs ar kodolreaktoru...

0:37:06.570,0:37:09.150
ir patiesi stulba ideja."

0:37:09.150,0:37:11.530
Bet militāristiem bija nauda: "Nebija tā, ka es
pēkšņi kļuvu par kodollidmašīnu atbalstītāju.

0:37:11.530,0:37:11.800
Drīzāk tas bija vienīgais ceļš, kā turpināt torija 
reaktora izstrādi. 

0:37:11.800,0:37:16.640
Tas, ka izstrādes iemesls bija idiotisks,
nebija tik ļoti svarīgi."

0:37:16.640,0:37:17.870
[smiekli]

0:37:17.870,0:37:24.640
"Augstas temperatūras reaktors būtu ļoti noderīgs
pat tad, ja tas nekad nepaceltu lidmašīnu."

0:37:24.640,0:37:26.410
Viņš zināja, ka lidmašīnā nav iespējams izmantot
ar ūdeni dzesējamu reaktoru.

0:37:26.410,0:37:30.330
Tajā nevar izmantot arī augsta spiediena reaktoru,
un arī sarežģītu cietās kodoldegvielas reaktoru.

0:37:30.330,0:37:35.620
Viņiem bija nepieciešams kaut kas tik elegants,
un tik vienkāršs un drošs,

0:37:35.620,0:37:40.170
ka to varētu darbināt zemā spiedienā un augstā temperatūrā.

0:37:40.170,0:37:41.950
Un viņš pat vēl nezināja, kas tas īsti varētu būt.

0:37:41.950,0:37:48.260
Ja nebūtu apstiprināta kodollidmašīnu programma,
kausēta sāls reaktors nebūtu izgudrots.

0:37:48.260,0:37:54.880
Jo tas ir tik radikāli savādāks,

0:37:54.880,0:38:00.380
tik ļoti prom no visiem citiem variantiem,
ka to nevar iegūt evolucionārā izstrādē.

0:38:00.380,0:38:06.720
Tā īpašības noteica tik stingras prasības,

0:38:06.720,0:38:09.160
cik stingras ir nepieciešamas kodollidmašīnai.

0:38:09.160,0:38:13.190
Tā nu viņi sāka darbu pie augstas temperatūras reaktora
izstrādes. Tam bija jāiztur tik augsta temperatūra,

0:38:13.190,0:38:13.440
ka ar tā siltumu varētu griezt lidmašīnas turbīnu.

0:38:13.420,0:38:13.800
Bija paredzēts, ka tas iesūc gaisu, un tad,

0:38:13.800,0:38:14.050
tā vietā, lai tajā sadedzinātu degvielu, to uzkarsētu
kodolreaktora siltummainī.

0:38:13.980,0:38:14.230
Un tad karsto gaisu izsviestu turbīnas izvadā,

0:38:13.980,0:38:14.230
nodrošinot nepieciešamo vilkmi.

0:38:13.980,0:38:14.230
Tā pati ideja, kas standarta turbodzinējā,
tikai siltuma avots nevis

0:38:14.020,0:38:16.060
naftas dedzināšana, bet gan kodolreaktors.
Atcerieties, ka tas notika vēl pirms

0:38:16.060,0:38:20.040
ballistiskajām raķetēm. Tas bija pasaules gala
ierocis.

0:38:20.040,0:38:23.890
Tātad, viņi sāka strādāt pie reaktora prasībām,
pat vēl nezinot, kā tās īsti realizēt.

0:38:23.890,0:38:27.040
Un viņi nonāca pie kausēta sāls reaktora idejas. 

0:38:27.040,0:38:30.550
Tā kā viņi nezināja, vai tas darbosies, viņi
izgatavoja reaktora principiālo modeli, 

0:38:30.550,0:38:35.720
ko nosauca par Lidaparāta reaktora eksperimentu.
Viņi pumpēja pa caurulēm izkausētus fluorīdus

0:38:35.720,0:38:38.230
un ieguva aptuveni pusmegavatu termālās jaudas. 

0:38:38.230,0:38:44.420
Ksenons ir gāze. Kas notiek ar gāzi šķidrumā?
Gāzveida kodoldalīšanās produkti

0:38:44.420,0:38:45.470
vienkārši izdalās no šķidruma.

0:38:45.470,0:38:50.690
Iedomājieties, kas notiktu, ja lidmašīna lidotu
ar Vīnera Vašingtonas reaktoru

0:38:50.690,0:38:54.930
uz Krieviju? Tas būtu apmēram tā:
"Šeit runā kapteinis. Mums ir nepieciešams 

0:38:54.930,0:38:58.570
veikt avārijas nosēšanos Sibīrijā.
Tā kā ksenona līmenis reaktorā ir pārāk augsts,

0:38:58.570,0:39:02.330
mēs uz deviņām stundām nosēdīsimies tundrā,

0:39:02.330,0:39:07.470
un, kad samazināsies ksenona līmenis,
mēs atkal turpināsim lidojumu."

0:39:07.470,0:39:08.390
Kā labi saprotat, tas nestrādātu.

0:39:08.390,0:39:11.120
Testa reaktors 1954 gadā nostrādāja aptuveni 11 dienas.

0:39:11.120,0:39:15.140
Tajā sasniedza tādu darba temperatūru, kāda nebija sasniegta
nevienā citā reaktorā

0:39:15.140,0:39:16.370
kas tajā laikā pastāvēja.

0:39:16.370,0:39:21.440
Un viņi pārliecinājās, ka ideja būtībā ir pareiza:
kausēta sāls reaktorā ir iespējams

0:39:21.440,0:39:26.250
nodrošināt kodolu dalīšanās reakciju augstā temperatūrā
un zemā spiedienā,

0:39:26.250,0:39:30.810
un ļoti stabili. Īpašās stabilitātes iemesls

0:39:30.810,0:39:35.900
bija tas, ka, ja sāli uzkarsē, tas izplešas un aktīvajā zonā
paliek mazāk materiāla,

0:39:35.900,0:39:38.020
un tāpēc reakcija palēlinās.

0:39:38.020,0:39:42.500
Un pretēji: ja sāls atdzisa un sarāvās, aktīvajā zonā ietilpa
vairāk materiāla

0:39:42.500,0:39:43.920
un reakcija noritēja ātrāk.

0:39:43.920,0:39:46.830
Inženieri šādas sistēmas sauc par dinamiski stabilām sistēmām.

0:39:46.830,0:39:49.450
Ja tas uzkarst, tad sāk atdzist, ja tas atdziest, tad sāk uzsilt.

0:39:49.450,0:39:55.530
Tas bija ap 1960. gadu. Attīstījās ballistiskās raķetes,
un par ērtāku risinājumu atzina

0:39:55.530,0:39:58.960
lidmašīnu uzpildīšanu gaisā. Gaisa spēki atzina, ka:
"Ziniet, patiesībā mums tas kodolbumbvedējs,

0:39:58.960,0:40:00.930
nav vairs īpaši vajadzīgs."

0:40:00.930,0:40:04.400
Vīnbergs rakstīja ASV Atomenerģijas komisijai un

0:40:04.400,0:40:09.590
dabūja nedaudz naudas. Tās pietika, lai uzbūvētu reaktoru,

0:40:09.590,0:40:12.860
ar jaudu zem 10 megavatiem. To nosauca par Kausēta sāls reaktoru.

0:40:12.860,0:40:14.640
Tas darbojās no 1965. līdz 1969. gadam.

0:40:14.640,0:40:19.070
Atklājās, ka torijs šādam reaktoram ir izcili piemērots.

0:40:19.070,0:40:22.520
Patiesībā tas bija divu šķidrumu kausēta sāls reaktors.

0:40:22.520,0:40:25.990
Kāda ir saistība starp kausēta sāls reaktoriem un LFTR
un otrādi?

0:40:25.990,0:40:30.860
LFTR (šķidra torija fluorīda reaktors)
ir kausēta sāls reaktors. Visi LFTR ir kausēta sāls

0:40:30.860,0:40:31.810
reaktori. Bet ne visi kausēta sāls reaktori ir LFTR
(torija fluorīda) reaktori.

0:40:31.810,0:40:37.690
Jums ir šķidra reaktora serde ar litija un berilija sāļiem
un urāna tetraflorīdu.

0:40:37.690,0:40:41.160
Un jūs vēlaties atdalīt kodoldegvielu no substrāta sāļiem.

0:40:41.160,0:40:45.740
Un to dara šādi. Visu šķidrumu ar kodoldegvielas un substrāta
sāļiem iepumpē

0:40:45.740,0:40:48.850
destilēšanas kolonnā.

0:40:48.850,0:40:54.930
Jūs pūšat cauri florīdam flora gāzi... un notiek sekojošais.
Urānam ir divi florīda veidi:

0:40:54.930,0:41:00.540
urāna tetrafluorīds ar četriem flora joniem un heksaflorīds

0:41:00.540,0:41:02.780
ar sešiem flora joniem.

0:41:02.780,0:41:04.270
Urāna heksaflorīds ir gāze.

0:41:04.270,0:41:06.650
Urāna tetraflorīds ir šķidrums.

0:41:06.650,0:41:11.000
Ja tetraflorīdam iesit ar flora atomu, tas kļūst par 
heksaflorīdu, un tas izdalās no šķidruma kā gāzes burbuļi.

0:41:11.000,0:41:15.160
Un tas ir ļoti elegants triks. Tādā veidā
atdalīt urānu no substrāta

0:41:15.160,0:41:19.210
var ļoti vienkārši. Urāns izgaro, bet substrāts paliek.

0:41:19.210,0:41:25.100
Tas nestrādātu, ja urāna īpašības būtu arī torijam.
Ja torija heksaflorīds būtu gāze,

0:41:25.100,0:41:29.780
mums būtu problēmas. Bet šī ir viena no dabas jaukajām
īpašībām.

0:41:29.780,0:41:33.370
Līdz ar to, jūs varat papildināt torija florīdu, kad vien vēlaties.
Tas nekur nepazudīs.

0:41:33.370,0:41:39.020
Tas paliks šķīdumā. Bet urāns izdalās gāzveida formā kā
urāna heksaflorīds. 

0:41:39.020,0:41:42.690
Tagad jums tas ir jāpievieno serdes sāļiem. 
Jūs pievadāt serdes sāļus šeit

0:41:42.690,0:41:47.810
un laižat tam cauri urāna heksaflorīdu un nedaudz

0:41:47.810,0:41:48.780
ūdeņraža gāzes.

0:41:48.780,0:41:54.680
Ūdeņradis saka UF6:
"Hei, vecais, man šos flora jonus vajag daudz vairāk nekā tev!"

0:41:54.680,0:42:01.380
Kamēr UF6 brīnās, ūdeņradis paņem no tā divus flora jonus,

0:42:01.380,0:42:05.460
un, hops! UF6 kļūst par UF4! Un atkal pārvēršas par šķidrumu.

0:42:05.460,0:42:11.210
Un jūs esat papildinājuši serdes sāļus ar urāna tetraflorīdu. 
Jauks triks, vai ne?

0:42:11.210,0:42:15.670
Un tā jūs nepārtraukti papildināt reaktora serdi ar urānu-233.

0:42:15.670,0:42:21.980
Un, lai arī urāns-233 kodolreakcijā tiek izlietots,
reakcijā izdalījušies neitroni 

0:42:21.980,0:42:23.770
no torija rada arvien jaunus urāna-233 krājumus.

0:42:23.770,0:42:29.820
Labi. No šīs destilācijas kolonnas kā gāze izdalās florūdeņražskābe HF.

0:42:29.820,0:42:34.490
Jūs to novadāt uz elektrolīzes iekārtu, un tajā
to atkal sadalāt 

0:42:34.490,0:42:39.950
ūdeņradī un florā. Un jūs esat atguvuši sākuma stāvoklī
visus reakcijā izmantotās sastāvdaļas.

0:42:39.950,0:42:44.770
Un jūs varat izmantot to pašu floru un ūdeņradi, lai turpinātu
šo atdalīšanas triku.

0:42:44.770,0:42:48.410
Izmantotās vielas jūs varat vienkārši nopirkt.
Tas ir cikls,

0:42:48.410,0:42:55.410
kurā rodas papildu kodoldegviela, un kurā jūs

0:42:56.650,0:43:00.880
pārvēršat toriju enerģijā. Vispirms kā U233, un no tā
sadalīšanās iegūstat enerģiju. Protams, lai to veiktu,

0:43:00.880,0:43:05.150
ir nepieciešams papildināt toriju. Tāpēc jums substrāta
sāļos ir nepieciešams

0:43:05.150,0:43:09.090
neliels torija fluorīda daudzums,
lai kompensētu iztērēto toriju

0:43:09.090,0:43:11.070
Tomēr tā ir ļoti ekonomiska reakcija.

0:43:11.070,0:43:14.370
Tagad apskatīsim tipisku kodolreaktoru.

0:43:14.370,0:43:18.480
Watts Bar Plant in Tennessee, I've actually
been to this nuclear reactor before. This

0:43:18.480,0:43:23.080
has a distinction of being the newest nuclear
reactor in the United States. This came online

0:43:23.080,0:43:28.460
in 1996.
A big pressurized water reactor vessel. 150

0:43:28.460,0:43:33.400
atmospheres, solid nuclear fuel. Fission is
going on. Water is being pumped through. It's

0:43:33.400,0:43:37.050
getting hotter. This water then goes through
a steam generator and in another loop of water

0:43:37.050,0:43:41.900
steam is being raised. It goes to the turbine,
spins the turbine, which spins the generator

0:43:41.900,0:43:43.200
makes electricity.

0:43:43.200,0:43:46.390
This is the steam turbine. And when I was
at Watts Bar this is the part I got to go

0:43:46.390,0:43:46.970
see.

0:43:46.970,0:43:53.970
There was not a skitch of dust on anything!
Now, if any of you have been to a coal plant

0:43:54.500,0:43:59.410
and seen the same steam turbine, because they
use the same technology at a coal plant. It

0:43:59.410,0:44:06.410
is nothing like this. A coal plant is dirty,
it's smelly, it's filthy, and it's dripping.

0:44:06.900,0:44:10.370
This thing was almost antiseptic in the way
it look.

0:44:10.370,0:44:10.620
Is there a need for that?

0:44:10.370,0:44:17.370
I don't know. So I'm standing next to this
machine. You can't really see a person, about

0:44:17.840,0:44:19.550
yay high here.

0:44:19.550,0:44:25.860
This is this low-pressure turbine. And this
is turning the shaft that's running this.

0:44:25.860,0:44:29.960
Now in front of this guy is this little thing
called the high-pressure turbine. And you

0:44:29.960,0:44:30.700
can't really see it. You see the big three
low-pressure turbines but you don't see the

0:44:30.700,0:44:32.090
high-pressure turbine. The high pressure turbine
is little bitty. It's like a third the size

0:44:32.090,0:44:37.200
of the generator. The high-pressure turbine
is making about two-thirds of the torque that's

0:44:37.200,0:44:38.310
turning the shaft.

0:44:38.310,0:44:42.490
And the low-pressure turbines are making about
one-third of the torque that's turning the

0:44:42.490,0:44:46.790
shaft. This little guy is doing almost all
the work and these big, big, big guys are

0:44:46.790,0:44:47.930
hardly doing anything.

0:44:47.930,0:44:51.740
When the steam goes into the high-pressure
turbine, it's dense. It's got a lot of energy

0:44:51.740,0:44:55.980
and a little volume. But then you let it blow
down as it goes across the high pressure turbine

0:44:55.980,0:44:58.000
and becomes low-pressure steam.

0:44:58.000,0:45:02.670
That's why these machines have to be so darn
big. Because the steam that's heating them

0:45:02.670,0:45:07.200
has already lost the vast majority of the
energy that it's going to give up.

0:45:07.200,0:45:12.380
This is the reactor itself, the reactor vessel
up here is where all the control rods slide

0:45:12.380,0:45:16.840
in and out of the core. And then there's these
four steam generators, as big if not bigger

0:45:16.840,0:45:20.190
than the reactors and they also have to operate
at these very high pressures.

0:45:20.190,0:45:27.190
There's four of them. Look at that. One, two,
three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Big

0:45:27.430,0:45:28.280
pipes.

0:45:28.280,0:45:32.630
The number one accident people worry about
with this kind of reactor is what's called

0:45:32.630,0:45:38.460
the double-ended pipe break. One of these
eight pipes, for whatever reason, shears.

0:45:38.460,0:45:44.600
And all of a sudden, pressure is lost in the
reactor. That water that's being held water

0:45:44.600,0:45:51.490
at 300 Celsius by 150 atmospheres of pressure,
when you lose pressure it flashes to steam,

0:45:51.490,0:45:57.070
almost instantly to steam. And when that happens,
its volume increases roughly by a factor of

0:45:57.070,0:46:02.330
1,000. So what was yay dense is now not so
dense anymore.

0:46:02.330,0:46:07.600
The other thing that happens is steam doesn't
take away heat nearly as well as liquid water

0:46:07.600,0:46:12.960
does from a surface. So all of a sudden your
fuel rods are not being cooled nearly as effectively

0:46:12.960,0:46:17.030
as they were before. Now fission will stop
because one of the things the water is doing

0:46:17.030,0:46:21.400
is slowing down the neutrons. So without the
water the fission reaction stops. You don't

0:46:21.400,0:46:27.550
have to put control rods in or anything. The
reactor will turn off immediately. But it

0:46:27.550,0:46:30.470
will still be generating heat from those fission
products.

0:46:30.470,0:46:35.810
Here's what'll happen if you have a double-ended
pipe break. You get this entire containment

0:46:35.810,0:46:36.890
vessel filled with water.

0:46:36.890,0:46:41.010
Now, I don't want to tell you all this because
I'm trying to focus on negative situations

0:46:41.010,0:46:44.870
here. I'm telling you this because this is
what drives the design of this building. This

0:46:44.870,0:46:51.660
building is the size it is and it's the way
it is precisely to accommodate this event.

0:46:51.660,0:46:57.650
They've designed this reactor so if this happens,
all the steam is captured in this building

0:46:57.650,0:46:58.750
and doesn't get out.

0:46:58.750,0:47:03.060
Look at the size of the reactor. Look at the
size of the containment building. It's huge.

0:47:03.060,0:47:09.150
It's much bigger than the reactor and it's
all driven by that thousand to one difference

0:47:09.150,0:47:14.830
in the density between steam and liquid water.
Now if this happens, you have to figure out

0:47:14.830,0:47:21.060
a way to get water back on the fuel rods to
cool them. So they have a series of emergency

0:47:21.060,0:47:25.380
systems in this reactor and they operate at
all different stages of pressure.

0:47:25.380,0:47:28.200
So the idea is if you're still at high pressure
and you've got to get water in there, we've

0:47:28.200,0:47:31.210
got a system for that. If you've lost some
of your pressure and you've got to get water

0:47:31.210,0:47:34.460
in there, we've got a system for that. If
you've lost all your pressure and we've got

0:47:34.460,0:47:37.900
to get water in there, we've got a system
for that. So there's a lot of systems and

0:47:37.900,0:47:42.200
then there's backups to those systems, and
it's all driven by this high pressure and

0:47:42.200,0:47:43.450
by the use of water.

0:47:43.450,0:47:43.920
Yes sir?

0:47:43.920,0:47:49.100
Does the control rod missile shield to keep
the control rods from punching a hole through

0:47:49.100,0:47:53.550
the roof if the steam explosion reaches the
reactor chamber?

0:47:53.550,0:47:58.340
Precisely. Here's the control rod drive mechanism.
Here's the rods. If you breach this part,

0:47:58.340,0:48:03.450
let's say the welding failed, and this thing
goes "boom" and out shoot the control rods,

0:48:03.450,0:48:07.020
that's there to keep them from doing bad things
like punching a hole in the top.

0:48:07.020,0:48:12.300
That actually did happen one time. That was
an army reactor and they did not have a containment

0:48:12.300,0:48:16.410
building. One poor guy got impaled to the
ceiling by a control rod so...

0:48:16.410,0:48:18.530
That's got to be the coolest way to die.

0:48:18.530,0:48:21.900
That was a real bad day. If he didn't get
impaled the radiation was going to get him.

0:48:21.900,0:48:26.810
The pinhole camera spotted several locations
and sources of high gamma radiation activity

0:48:26.810,0:48:33.170
outside the reactor vessel presumably from
reactor components blown from the core by

0:48:33.170,0:48:34.920
the force of the 500 PSI explosion.

0:48:34.920,0:48:38.480
The reactor vessel is about nine inch thick
steel. When you've got nine inch thick steel

0:48:38.480,0:48:42.460
and it has to be nuclear grade and it has
to be perfect, you can't go and weld nine

0:48:42.460,0:48:46.850
inch thick steel. They don't make it that
way. They forge it in one piece. Not a lot

0:48:46.850,0:48:53.800
of people have the capability to build a 10-meter
diameter, 20-meter long, single piece, nine

0:48:53.800,0:48:57.920
inch thick forging. In fact, there's exactly
one place in the world you can build this.

0:48:57.920,0:49:00.670
It's a place called Japan Steel Works in Japan.

0:49:00.670,0:49:03.320
It's a limiting factor because you say "I
want to build lots and lots of nuclear reactors."

0:49:03.320,0:49:07.670
Either you're going to build a new heavy forging,
which is really just for this task, or you're

0:49:07.670,0:49:11.460
going to wait a long time to get your reactor
in line to go do this.

0:49:11.460,0:49:14.160
Let me diss on water a few more times.

0:49:14.160,0:49:16.960
Here's why water is not such a great thing
for the inside of a nuclear reactor. Number

0:49:16.960,0:49:22.430
one, it can't hack the temperature, we already
talked about that. Number two, it's a covalently

0:49:22.430,0:49:27.790
bonded substance. The oxygen has a covalent
bond with two hydrogens. Neither one of those

0:49:27.790,0:49:33.440
bonds is strong enough to survive getting
smacked around by a gamma or a neutron. They're

0:49:33.440,0:49:37.600
just going too fast. Sure enough, they knock
the hydrogens clean off.

0:49:37.600,0:49:42.310
Now, in a water cooled reactor, you have a
system called a recombiner that will take

0:49:42.310,0:49:47.890
the hydrogen gas and the oxygen gas that is
always being created from the nuclear reaction

0:49:47.890,0:49:51.740
and put them back together, because chemically
they'd much rather be water than being hydrogen

0:49:51.740,0:49:56.420
and oxygen. It's a great system as long as
it's operating and the system is pumping.

0:49:56.420,0:50:01.030
Well, at Fukushima Daiichi, the problem was
that the pumping power stopped. When the pumping

0:50:01.030,0:50:07.140
power stopped, water was still getting busted
apart. Hydrogen is real light, and even though

0:50:07.140,0:50:11.780
it wants to get with oxygen again it will
dissociate fairly quickly. The hydrogen will

0:50:11.780,0:50:15.430
sit at the top of the vessel and the oxygen
will sit in a layer below it, and then there's

0:50:15.430,0:50:16.200
the water.

0:50:16.200,0:50:20.630
The designers of that particular reactor had
intentionally designed it so that you would

0:50:20.630,0:50:24.830
vent the hydrogen outside of the containment
building. This has always been kind of controversial.

0:50:24.830,0:50:29.310
They ducted the hydrogen up to the upper decks
of the reactor, which were outside the containment.

0:50:29.310,0:50:33.870
They're just kind of a sparse steel frame
structure up there. And one, two, three, we

0:50:33.870,0:50:38.460
say it happen on the news. First one filled
with hydrogen, got to a certain point, boom.

0:50:38.460,0:50:41.620
The news said, "Oh, We had a nuclear explosion.",
and I'm like, "No, we didn't. It wasn't a

0:50:41.620,0:50:44.720
nuclear explosion. It was a hydrogen gas explosion."
It didn't burst the containment.

0:50:44.720,0:50:49.690
I don't want to diminish it too much but it
was not nearly as scary as it sounded. It

0:50:49.690,0:50:51.420
happened one, two, three.

0:50:51.420,0:50:56.900
The tsunami hit about an hour after the reactors
were shut down. Fission was long gone by the

0:50:56.900,0:51:01.130
time the tsunami came along. But the reactors
were still managing decay heat. The tsunami

0:51:01.130,0:51:05.000
came and destroyed the diesel generators,
but they still had batteries and those batteries

0:51:05.000,0:51:06.810
ran for about eight hours.

0:51:06.810,0:51:10.790
That eight hours was the most important time
of all. If you had to pick eight hours to

0:51:10.790,0:51:14.350
make sure that the pumps were still working,
those first eight hours were the most important

0:51:14.350,0:51:18.760
time. By the time the batteries ran dry and
the pumps stopped, the reactor had gotten

0:51:18.760,0:51:24.230
past the worst part of its decay heat comedown.
It was still going on, decay heat doesn't

0:51:24.230,0:51:28.370
turn off, and it continues even in spent fuel.
That decay heat continued to build. Heat was

0:51:28.370,0:51:30.160
not being removed from the reactor.

0:51:30.160,0:51:32.840
Why weren't they using the power from the
reactor to run the pumps? Because the reactor

0:51:32.840,0:51:33.400
had been turned off.

0:51:33.400,0:51:38.360
This shows if you do stupid designs, something
bad will happen, even after 40 years. A friend

0:51:38.360,0:51:42.620
of mine was GE's first nuclear safety engineer
and he worked on the Fukushima plant, and

0:51:42.620,0:51:46.860
they would have meetings with the TEPCO officials
and engineers and they would all nod their

0:51:46.860,0:51:50.750
heads in long meetings and say "We'll do this,
we'll do that," and then they go off after

0:51:50.750,0:51:55.620
the meeting and do whatever they wanted. That's
why you had a 15-foot sea wall with a 45-foot

0:51:55.620,0:51:58.850
wave coming over, and diesel generators and
fuel in the basement.

0:51:58.850,0:52:02.940
It has nothing to do with nuclear power, it
has to do with bad management and you wouldn't

0:52:02.940,0:52:09.940
even design a simple factory the way that
was designed. I'm sure you could talk to the

0:52:11.550,0:52:15.750
Japanese representative here about TEPCO's
management getting kicked out years ago for

0:52:15.750,0:52:18.290
fraud and other things. They've had a history.

0:52:18.290,0:52:23.170
Let me talk about today's nuclear fuel, because
that is common to both boiling water reactors,

0:52:23.170,0:52:28.540
pressurized water reactors and CANDUs. This
is a handful of these uranium oxide fuel pellets.

0:52:28.540,0:52:33.630
The guy's got gloves on and it's easy to think
he's got gloves on to protect him from the

0:52:33.630,0:52:37.410
uranium oxide, but now that I've taught you
about the true nature of radioactivity, you

0:52:37.410,0:52:41.030
might go "I'm not so sure that stuff's so
dangerous after all," and you would be correct.

0:52:41.030,0:52:45.630
He is not protecting himself from the uranium,
he's protecting the uranium from himself.

0:52:45.630,0:52:49.910
That stuff has to stay super pure and super
clean and you don't want to get any of your

0:52:49.910,0:52:55.090
oils, or grease or sweat on nuclear fuel that's
going to go inside a fuel rod so that's what

0:52:55.090,0:52:56.330
the gloves are for.

0:52:56.330,0:53:00.660
They take these fuel pellets and slide them
down these zirconium tubes and they actually

0:53:00.660,0:53:05.180
will segregate the pellets along the length
of the fuel assembly according to enrichment.

0:53:05.180,0:53:08.440
They'll put the most enriched ones in the
middle, and then they'll kind of decrease

0:53:08.440,0:53:13.800
the enrichment along the length of the fuel
assemblies. It's really, really expensive

0:53:13.800,0:53:15.930
to fabricate solid fuel.

0:53:15.930,0:53:21.180
Back in the day, their business model for
how to make a nuclear reactor was sometimes

0:53:21.180,0:53:26.540
referred to as a "razor blades business model,"
in other words sell these reactors to utilities

0:53:26.540,0:53:31.670
pretty much at cost in order to lock them
in to a long-term supply contract.

0:53:31.670,0:53:35.500
It was good money for them, because once somebody's
bought your reactor, they're going to buy

0:53:35.500,0:53:39.460
your Westinghouse 17x17 array fuel. They're
not going to go "Hey, GE, what kind of deal

0:53:39.460,0:53:42.240
can you give me on this?" And be told "Dude,
you don't have my reactor." You're working

0:53:42.240,0:53:46.400
with that guy, there's no market out there
once you build the reactor, you're using his

0:53:46.400,0:53:49.630
fuel. If he decides to change the price on
you, well, that's tough.

0:53:49.630,0:53:53.410
Here's the reactor. It's got its lid off,
and then they'll fill the whole thing up to

0:53:53.410,0:53:57.120
a level with water, so they make the whole
thing into a swimming pool. Fill this whole

0:53:57.120,0:54:02.030
thing up with water, because the water is
radiation shielding. They take the fuel assemblies

0:54:02.030,0:54:06.480
out and put it in the spent fuel pool. This
is what they have to do about every 18 months

0:54:06.480,0:54:10.800
to the reactor. They'll take out about a third
of the fuel and then they'll load in about

0:54:10.800,0:54:14.850
a third new fresh fuel and then they'll reshuffle
the fuel that's already been in there. They'll

0:54:14.850,0:54:17.430
move it from the center out to the periphery.

0:54:17.430,0:54:21.170
It's like "Lord of the Rings," "The Great
Eye is looking," no, it's really not in the

0:54:21.170,0:54:26.050
eye. Here is what it really is. It's a cross-section
of nuclear fuel. This is uranium oxide and

0:54:26.050,0:54:30.290
when you put it in a reactor for a while,
one of the things xenon does, it's a gas,

0:54:30.290,0:54:35.610
so it's way, way, way less dense than solid
fuel. When you make this gas, it starts to

0:54:35.610,0:54:38.540
break up the solid structure of the fuel.

0:54:38.540,0:54:43.510
The solid fuel will begin to swell and crack
and the gasses, the krypton and the xenon

0:54:43.510,0:54:47.680
begin to fill up, and you begin to get this
central void. This is actually a gap in the

0:54:47.680,0:54:50.300
fuel. Fission product gasses will accumulate
here.

0:54:50.300,0:54:55.440
Wigner didn't like solid fuel. He was a chemical
engineer by training and he thought, "What

0:54:55.440,0:55:00.200
kind of industrial process do we run chemically
based on solids?" He goes "We don't. Everything

0:55:00.200,0:55:04.740
we do, we use as liquids or gasses because
we can mix them completely." You can take

0:55:04.740,0:55:08.560
a liquid, you can fully mix it. You can take
a gas, you can fully mix it. You can't take

0:55:08.560,0:55:12.490
a solid and fully mix it unless you turn it
into a liquid or a gas.

0:55:12.490,0:55:17.110
To give you an idea, here's what we do today.
We make this solid uranium oxide fuel and

0:55:17.110,0:55:21.600
there's a single pellet, and then we put them
in these big reactor fuel elements, zirconium

0:55:21.600,0:55:24.760
tubes that are like 12 feet long and about
this big around. We then stick them in the

0:55:24.760,0:55:29.660
reactor and irradiate them for a couple of
years. We only burn up a small amount of the

0:55:29.660,0:55:32.910
uranium that's in there, we take it out and
we stick it in a spent fuel pool. It is not

0:55:32.910,0:55:34.010
very efficient.

0:55:34.010,0:55:38.740
The heavy water reactor will use about 0.7
percent energy value and the light water...

0:55:38.740,0:55:44.120
Reactors in the United States, we're extracting
about half of 1 percent of the energy that's

0:55:44.120,0:55:47.750
in the uranium. You can imagine going to your
boss saying "I developed a new system", "Well

0:55:47.750,0:55:53.450
how efficient is it?", "It's less than 1 percent",
"Excuse me, what did you build? I think you

0:55:53.450,0:55:56.460
need to go work on that again," you know.
We just simply wouldn't accept this.

0:55:56.460,0:56:00.640
I'm an engineer. If you're that far off 100
percent, man I want to get a whole lot closer

0:56:00.640,0:56:05.290
and Weinberg did too. They wanted to get to
nearly 100 percent of the energy utilization.

0:56:05.290,0:56:08.710
The molten salt reactor experiment was the
core part of it. They didn't have a blanket

0:56:08.710,0:56:12.480
around it, they just wanted to see if they
could get the first step to work, and they

0:56:12.480,0:56:13.610
were successful.

0:56:13.610,0:56:17.970
After they completed the molten salt reactor
experiment, they went to the Atomic Energy

0:56:17.970,0:56:21.920
Commission they said "Hey, G, can we have
some more money? We'd like to go now and build

0:56:21.920,0:56:27.640
the real thing. We'd like to build the blanket
and hook a power conversion system on and

0:56:27.640,0:56:32.120
make electricity," they felt like they'd shot
the moon. The Atomic Energy Commission unfortunately

0:56:32.120,0:56:34.110
did not share their zeal.

0:56:34.110,0:56:39.160
They had invested very heavily in an alternative
technology, the plutonium fast breeder reactor

0:56:39.160,0:56:46.160
based on solid fuels and turning abundant
uranium-238 into plutonium-239 and then burning

0:56:46.280,0:56:50.800
it in the reactor. It involved a whole different
set of technologies that were much more in

0:56:50.800,0:56:56.770
line with the light water reactors. It's funny,
even at that time 50 years ago, nobody thought

0:56:56.770,0:57:00.850
the light water reactor, the heavy water reactor
would be around very long. They were just

0:57:00.850,0:57:04.740
simply too inefficient in their use of nuclear
fuel.

0:57:04.740,0:57:08.000
Like I was saying, the Atomic Energy Commission
said "Hey, guess what, we're putting all this

0:57:08.000,0:57:12.080
money in the fast breeder. We've got all these
companies lined up to do the fast breeder.

0:57:12.080,0:57:17.720
They even actually built one in Monroe, Michigan.
It had had a meltdown. They were undeterred,

0:57:17.720,0:57:22.140
they were moving forward and so they told
Weinberg to take a hike.

0:57:22.140,0:57:26.330
The story gets a little more complicated too
because in addition to being a thorium guru,

0:57:26.330,0:57:30.860
Weinberg was also the original inventor of
the pressurized water reactor. He had invented

0:57:30.860,0:57:37.680
it and gotten his patent for it in 1947, so
it was a little bit of a tricky thing to have

0:57:37.680,0:57:44.250
the inventor of the light water reactor advocating
for something very, very, very different.

0:57:44.250,0:57:48.410
And got a little worse than that too, because
Weinberg was never really crazy about the

0:57:48.410,0:57:51.430
light water reactor. He didn't like the fact
that it had to run at really high pressure.

0:57:51.430,0:57:57.330
There would be an accident someday where you
were not able to maintain the pressure or

0:57:57.330,0:58:02.800
keep cooling it. There could be a meltdown,
there could be a release of radioactivity.

0:58:02.800,0:58:08.480
Does any of this sound familiar? And he was
making enough of a stink about this that there

0:58:08.480,0:58:10.530
was a congressional leader named Chet Holifield...

0:58:10.530,0:58:13.720
A member of the joint Congressional Atomic
Energy Committee...

0:58:13.720,0:58:18.520
Who told Alvin Weinberg, he said, "If you're
so concerned about the safety of nuclear energy,

0:58:18.520,0:58:23.090
it might be time for you to leave the nuclear
business." He wasn't questioning the value

0:58:23.090,0:58:28.550
or the importance of nuclear energy, if anything
he was far more convinced about that than

0:58:28.550,0:58:29.890
anyone else.

0:58:29.890,0:58:34.800
What he was questioning was whether the right
path been taken in the development of nuclear

0:58:34.800,0:58:39.710
reactors. He was particularly well suited
to make that question because his role as

0:58:39.710,0:58:45.140
inventor of predominant technology so he was
quietly shown the door.

0:58:45.140,0:58:50.480
After he had left Oak Ridge you can imagine
things did not go well for the research team

0:58:50.480,0:58:54.750
the Atomic Energy Commission, commissioned
a report WASH 1222 I like to call it white

0:58:54.750,0:58:56.420
wash 1222.

0:58:56.420,0:59:01.810
Because they really nitpicked on three very,
very small issues about the reactor and said

0:59:01.810,0:59:06.990
look big problems here. I don't think we can
go forward until these are resolved. When

0:59:06.990,0:59:11.940
it came time to talk about the safety and
the performance of the reactor there may be

0:59:11.940,0:59:18.940
some safety advantages that haven't been quantified
yet regarding this approach but you know we

0:59:19.510,0:59:23.080
just really can't be sure about that.

0:59:23.080,0:59:26.570
Just burns me up because I think big, big,
big mistake United States made in walking

0:59:26.570,0:59:27.900
away from this.

0:59:27.900,0:59:31.660
So they put all their chips fast breeder reactor
and that didn't work out too well for them.

0:59:31.660,0:59:35.540
They start building one in Tennessee. The
program ended up in getting canceled by Carter

0:59:35.540,0:59:40.410
in 1979 and was briefly resurrected by Reagan
in 1981 and then cancelled again. So that's

0:59:40.410,0:59:43.760
what happened to fast breed reactor in the
United States, a couple of countries kept

0:59:43.760,0:59:44.280
going with it.

0:59:44.280,0:59:48.720
The French went with it in eighties they built
Phénix and Superphénix and then they ended

0:59:48.720,0:59:52.470
up shutting down there fast breeder too and
the Japanese tried it but they had several

0:59:52.470,0:59:55.720
but one called Monju and it had been shut
down since the mid 90s.

0:59:55.720,0:59:59.490
Then a few months ago they turned it back
on and then somebody dropped a crane in liquid

0:59:59.490,1:00:03.840
sodium and then they shut it off again, so
you know everybody has tried the fast breeder

1:00:03.840,1:00:05.620
reactor. I think the Russian's are trying
it.

1:00:05.620,1:00:09.690
I have some good friends in nuclear industry.
They are very big advocates of the fast breeder

1:00:09.690,1:00:15.050
reactor. The common name for now is the integral
fast reactor. I am not the biggest fan a reactor

1:00:15.050,1:00:19.220
that is full of liquid sodium. If any of you
are chemists in here you probably recall sodium

1:00:19.220,1:00:26.220
has a great infinity for just about everything.

1:00:27.740,1:00:29.740
What are your thoughts on the traveling wave
reactor?

1:00:29.740,1:00:34.120
The traveling wave reactor is another form
of a liquid metal fast breeder reactor. It

1:00:34.120,1:00:38.290
is a particularly difficult implementation
of that reactor. That reactor is already hard

1:00:38.290,1:00:42.590
to build in first place, with the traveling
wave they make it even more complicated by

1:00:42.590,1:00:47.370
saying we are going to leave the fuel in the
reactor for the lifetime of the reactor.

1:00:47.370,1:00:52.880
Physically propagate this deflagration wave,
a nuclear conversion and burning wave. Why

1:00:52.880,1:00:56.880
on Earth would you take such a hard reactor
and make it even harder to what end? What

1:00:56.880,1:01:01.120
is your goal? And all I've been able to read
as far as their goal is that they want to

1:01:01.120,1:01:04.000
never have to recycle or replace the fuel.

1:01:04.000,1:01:07.430
At the end of their life their concept is
to just bury the thing in the ground and leave

1:01:07.430,1:01:12.850
it there. I'm thinking, "You don't leave a
bunch of plutonium in a pool of liquid sodium

1:01:12.850,1:01:17.270
underground for an extended period of time
that is a bad disposal option."

1:01:17.270,1:01:21.400
They have attracted Bill Gate who of course
is an extremely wealthy man. If Bill Gates

1:01:21.400,1:01:24.810
wants to save a lot of money he can get in
touch with me and I think I can talk him out

1:01:24.810,1:01:25.820
of traveling wave.

1:01:25.820,1:01:29.780
He won't return my calls. Don't feel bad.

1:01:29.780,1:01:35.350
I used to be so into fusion, specially helium-3
fusion, mining in the mood. Oh my God! I've

1:01:35.350,1:01:37.360
read so many books about that stuff.

1:01:37.360,1:01:39.850
Fusion is magical. If we make that happen
it would be magical.

1:01:39.850,1:01:43.780
I took this fusion class when I was at Georgia
Tech and I will never forget it. We started

1:01:43.780,1:01:46.230
studying and I go, "Man, this is really hard."

1:01:46.230,1:01:50.930
Charged particles don't want to get near each
other. Bare nuclei are both charged, positive

1:01:50.930,1:01:52.240
charged, they want to avoid each other.

1:01:52.240,1:01:55.490
And my professor had a really great way of
putting it. "It's like going to the mini golf."

1:01:55.490,1:01:59.050
He says, "You know how in mini golf you've
got the volcano, and the volcano's got the

1:01:59.050,1:02:02.870
hole at the very top, and you've got to putt
your ball in a way that it goes all the way

1:02:02.870,1:02:07.990
up the side of the volcano, and 'phwep!' falls
in the hole." He goes, "OK. That's like fusion.

1:02:07.990,1:02:12.570
The ball is like a nucleus, and the volcano
is the scattering effect.

1:02:12.570,1:02:16.570
So any time you want to have a nucleus go
to another nucleus, it scatters; it rolls

1:02:16.570,1:02:19.830
up the mountain and it rolls down the side,
it rolls over here, over there... and only

1:02:19.830,1:02:23.770
when you just perfectly get it on the right
angle does it go in the volcano." Now, the

1:02:23.770,1:02:27.030
problem with fusion, he goes, "You can't steer
the ball, you have to have enough temperature

1:02:27.030,1:02:30.600
so that it can make it all the way up the
side of the volcano and fall in, and then

1:02:30.600,1:02:34.030
you have to have enough balls because you
can't steer them there at the mini golf park",

1:02:34.030,1:02:37.760
that's density, "and then because they're
flying all over the place, you've got to make

1:02:37.760,1:02:40.500
sure that there's a fence around the mini
golf park so that they don't get away." That's

1:02:40.500,1:02:40.810
confinement.

1:02:40.810,1:02:45.240
He said, "Those are your three things, density,
temperature, and confinement, to make fusion

1:02:45.240,1:02:45.490
happen."

1:02:45.440,1:02:49.350
I said, "Dude, that's really hard!" So, I
came up with another analogy, "So, I guess

1:02:49.350,1:02:54.500
fission would be like the mini golf park except
now the volcano was flush, the hole was about

1:02:54.500,1:02:58.580
this big around, the balls are going slow,
and every time the ball goes in the hole,

1:02:58.580,1:02:59.860
two more balls come out."

1:02:59.860,1:03:02.800
He goes, "Yeah, that's pretty good."

1:03:02.800,1:03:07.870
I've looked at focus fusion, I've looked at
steam-piston fusion, I've looked at D-helium-3

1:03:07.870,1:03:11.590
and P-boron, and all these other kind of things
and I'm still going, "I'm just not buying

1:03:11.590,1:03:12.110
it yet."

1:03:12.110,1:03:14.740
You're saying the business case isn't there.
That's what you're saying.

1:03:14.740,1:03:20.280
It's just so darn hard! I mean, a fusion reactor
is a big vacuum tube at 10 keV, which is like

1:03:20.280,1:03:26.510
15 patrillion degrees, and then inside this
are superconducting magnets that are held

1:03:26.510,1:03:31.610
in liquid helium, and all of this is jacketed
in a lithium blanket that will breed megacuries

1:03:31.610,1:03:37.650
of tritium, which will then be injected into
this reactor which is driven by these giant

1:03:37.650,1:03:38.120
neutral-ion beams.

1:03:38.120,1:03:42.530
I mean, it's like, "Oh my gosh! Can we make
this thing any more complicated then it is?"

1:03:42.530,1:03:46.840
And even then you can't hold the confinement
for more than a few microseconds in the Tokamak

1:03:46.840,1:03:49.650
configuration, which is the most favored and
desired.

1:03:49.650,1:03:54.420
Thorium's actually a little bit more down
to earth. If you go to the liquid form, force

1:03:54.420,1:03:59.340
yourself to make that technology commitment,
50 years from now, people will go, "Of course

1:03:59.340,1:04:00.530
that's the answer!"

1:04:00.530,1:04:04.190
Fusion is so hard that we can build a fusion
reactor, and we can have 100 PhDs working

1:04:04.190,1:04:07.680
on it. Fission is so easy that we can take
a couple of kids out of high school, train

1:04:07.680,1:04:09.910
them for a few months, and they can be running
a nuclear submarine.

1:04:09.910,1:04:16.130
Want to build a reactor to bring energy for
the oil sands. This would be the perfect opportunity.

1:04:16.130,1:04:21.630
Well, if we have a reactor like this, do we
need the oil sands?

1:04:21.630,1:04:28.630
I mean, that's the way I look at it; I don't
know a lot about oil sands, but I know that

1:04:28.810,1:04:33.160
it's a particularly hard way to get oil. People
in the middle east can get oil a whole lot

1:04:33.160,1:04:37.570
cheaper from their place then people can get
it from the oil sands. If I can beat them

1:04:37.570,1:04:41.050
by a million to one, maybe we ought to do
that.

1:04:41.050,1:04:46.220
If you were to make the oil sands just a little
tiny bit cleaner, then they would perk up

1:04:46.220,1:04:50.450
their ears, as opposed to clean energy in
and of itself, because it relates to something

1:04:50.450,1:04:50.930
they know.

1:04:50.930,1:04:54.920
I sat on the plane next to a guy who was in
the oil business, and he was telling me all

1:04:54.920,1:04:58.020
about the oil sands, and how much money they're
making and so forth. I was just sort of sitting

1:04:58.020,1:04:59.770
there, taking it in, listening...

1:04:59.770,1:05:02.210
Gas... How much does gas cost here?

1:05:02.210,1:05:04.620
A dollar... A dollar ten?

1:05:04.620,1:05:07.630
Gas costs a dollar ten?

1:05:07.630,1:05:13.210
Yeah, it's expensive, because we have more
tax on gasoline, which I think is a good idea.

1:05:13.210,1:05:14.790
What do you pay for gas?

1:05:14.790,1:05:16.390
I'm paying like, $3.50 for gas.

1:05:16.390,1:05:17.130
Really?

1:05:17.130,1:05:18.550
I thought gas was cheaper in America!

1:05:18.550,1:05:21.020
The Canadian dollar's almost on par, isn't
it?

1:05:21.020,1:05:21.330
Yeah.

1:05:21.330,1:05:24.660
Oh wait... you all do it in liters!

1:05:24.660,1:05:29.970
Do we pump your car with gas and go, "I just
pumped twelve gallons of gas into my car.

1:05:29.970,1:05:34.040
Do you know how much napalm that would make?
If I dropped that on a village, I would kill

1:05:34.040,1:05:38.440
5,000 little children!" You know, and you're
like, "No! Of course not! I'm going to get

1:05:38.440,1:05:42.280
into my car and drive 300 miles on it!" I
mean, it's all about what you do; none of

1:05:42.280,1:05:46.970
this stuff is inherently good or bad, it's
what you decide to do with it.

1:05:46.970,1:05:50.830
You know, one of the things that doesn't earn
me a lot of friends is the notion when we

1:05:50.830,1:05:56.120
talk about, "Oh, so-and-so can't enrich uranium,"
I go, "No offense, but who are we to tell

1:05:56.120,1:06:01.030
anybody what they can do?" I mean, uranium's
uranium, and it's not exactly like we have

1:06:01.030,1:06:02.520
a monopoly on the stuff.

1:06:02.520,1:06:05.630
Same thing goes for things like plutonium.
Plutonium is... I'm not the biggest fan of

1:06:05.630,1:06:10.100
plutonium because I'm not crazy about the
plutonium fast-breeder reactor, but there's

1:06:10.100,1:06:15.420
nothing good or bad about plutonium. Plutonium
just is. It's what you decide to do with it.

1:06:15.420,1:06:18.700
Now, we've made a lot of plutonium in our
reactors. What are we going to do with it?

1:06:18.700,1:06:21.790
Are we going to drop it in a hole in the ground,
or are we going to feed it to a reactor like

1:06:21.790,1:06:25.690
LFTR and make power out of it? I think that's
a whole lot smarter thing to do.

1:06:25.690,1:06:29.130
The other day I was debating some anti-nukes,
and they were getting on LFTR because they

1:06:29.130,1:06:33.820
said, "Oh, this is going to use uranium. You
know, from nuclear weapons!" And I said, "I

1:06:33.820,1:06:38.700
think you guys would be all over that! Take
nuclear weapons, take them apart, take the

1:06:38.700,1:06:41.640
uranium out, burn it up, make electricity!
You want to leave it in the bomb? What do

1:06:41.640,1:06:42.470
you want to do with it?"

1:06:42.470,1:06:47.470
The Navy has as many reactors as we have in
the civilian world. Think about the security

1:06:47.470,1:06:52.630
posture that the US would have if we didn't
have this nuclear capability. Submarines can

1:06:52.630,1:06:57.250
stay underwater and go under the polar ice
cap. If you look the ground forces today,

1:06:57.250,1:07:01.750
we seem to be using a lot of energy, people
wonder if we could cut that down. The energy

1:07:01.750,1:07:03.710
is used for good purposes.

1:07:03.710,1:07:09.370
So, the reason that we can fight in the night,
take out enemies without losing our own soldiers

1:07:09.370,1:07:15.120
is because we have energy powered capabilities.
We have sensors, radios, all sorts of things

1:07:15.120,1:07:18.330
that give us the advantage, and they're all
based on energy. The way that we're sustaining

1:07:18.330,1:07:21.910
the force is we're trucking liquids over the
ground.

1:07:21.910,1:07:26.260
When I was waiting to go into Iraq since we
began invasion in 2003 some of generals couldn't

1:07:26.260,1:07:31.030
get spare parts or supplies out forward because
the convoys were busy carrying fuel and water.

1:07:31.030,1:07:35.270
More significantly, cost in lives, half of
our losses in Iraq are associated with the

1:07:35.270,1:07:36.040
supply chain.

1:07:36.040,1:07:39.480
If we didn't have to carry all that liquid
- 80 percent of the supply chain - we might

1:07:39.480,1:07:43.750
be able to find another way, something called
an adaptive brigade. This force could provide

1:07:43.750,1:07:48.090
its own energy and water and not really have
to be resupplied for say a month at a time.

1:07:48.090,1:07:52.280
If you need energy during the day, put about
a hundred acres of solar panels.

1:07:52.280,1:07:54.940
If you have a threat out there, that might
not work too well because you have to secure

1:07:54.940,1:07:59.240
the whole perimeter and so now all your soldiers
spend their time patrolling the hundred acre

1:07:59.240,1:08:00.210
solar farm.

1:08:00.210,1:08:06.920
What if we had a reactor that was so safe
and simple and economical that you could take

1:08:06.920,1:08:12.060
it out to the battlefield and use it, and
then when you leave, leave it for the host

1:08:12.060,1:08:13.910
nation and they run it.

1:08:13.910,1:08:18.349
Prosperity is related to energy. If we can
bring people to about 2,000 kilowatt hours

1:08:18.349,1:08:24.150
per year of electrical energy, they have a
chance of achieving prosperity. Now, of course,

1:08:24.150,1:08:29.329
prosperity depends upon the rule of law, good
government, property rights, education, but

1:08:29.329,1:08:36.329
electric power for heat, light, transportation,
safety and so on is a critical element of

1:08:37.499,1:08:38.579
prosperity today.

1:08:38.579,1:08:43.449
Developing countries know this. Energy in
coal use is growing rapidly in all the developing

1:08:43.449,1:08:47.679
countries. They want to achieve that level
of prosperity and they're being supported

1:08:47.679,1:08:49.130
by Peabody Coal.

1:08:49.130,1:08:54.679
The National Academy of Sciences said that
every freshwater fish in the United States

1:08:54.679,1:09:00.019
of America now has dangerous levels of mercury
in its flesh. And that mercury is coming from

1:09:00.019,1:09:01.670
coal burning power plants.

1:09:01.670,1:09:06.739
My levels of mercury came back 10 times the
amount of what the EPA considers safe. I was

1:09:06.739,1:09:11.819
told by Dr. David Carpenter, who is the national
authority on mercury toxins, that a woman

1:09:11.819,1:09:15.819
with my levels of mercury in her blood would
have children with cognitive impairment with

1:09:15.819,1:09:16.999
permanent brain damage.

1:09:16.999,1:09:21.119
I said, "Do you mean she might have?" And
he said, "No, no, no. The science is very

1:09:21.119,1:09:26.539
clear right now." Her children would have
some level of permanent neurological impairment,

1:09:26.539,1:09:30.650
probably as a permanent IQ loss in those kids
of five to seven points.

1:09:30.650,1:09:36.559
There are now 640,000 children born in this
country every year who've been exposed to

1:09:36.559,1:09:41.409
dangerous levels of mercury in their mother's
wombs. Ozone and particulates from coal burning

1:09:41.409,1:09:48.409
power plants kill 60,000 Americans a year.
A million asthma attacks, a million lost workdays

1:09:49.639,1:09:51.230
every year.

1:09:51.230,1:09:55.079
That's part of the cost of coal that they
don't tell you about when they say "Oh, it's

1:09:55.079,1:09:57.679
only, you know, ten cents a kilowatt hour."

1:09:57.679,1:10:04.090
Both light water reactors and CANDUs do not
use very much of the energy in the fuel and

1:10:04.090,1:10:08.320
they leave behind two classes of materials.
One is the actual fission products - that's

1:10:08.320,1:10:12.239
what happens when you fission the stuff. Then
there is what's called the transuranics. That's

1:10:12.239,1:10:15.880
what happens when the uranium absorbs the
neutron and doesn't fission, and turns into

1:10:15.880,1:10:19.190
plutonium, americium and curium and few other,
most of it is plutonium.

1:10:19.190,1:10:23.280
The overwhelming majority of transuranics
are plutonium. So when you talk to people

1:10:23.280,1:10:28.530
about waste disposal, they say, "What's the
concern?" Well, most of the stuff that's in

1:10:28.530,1:10:32.900
the fuel is just uranium. It's no more radioactive
than it was when you stuck it in, and it's

1:10:32.900,1:10:35.130
not really a concern.

1:10:35.130,1:10:40.630
And the fission products, they are very radioactive
when they are created, but they decay rather

1:10:40.630,1:10:46.199
quickly. They don't really have long-term
radioactivity. They just decay too fast, it

1:10:46.199,1:10:49.679
is the deal. There are a few of them that
have very long half-lives but that means their

1:10:49.679,1:10:53.110
radioactivity levels are extremely low and
they just don't really pose a hazard.

1:10:53.110,1:10:59.159
The real challenge with spent fuel management
is the presence of those transuranics - plutonium,

1:10:59.159,1:11:03.679
americium, curium - because they have moderate
half-lives and they have complicated decay

1:11:03.679,1:11:06.690
chains. When you're looking at a Yucca mountain
or a disposal site you say, "What are we going

1:11:06.690,1:11:07.219
to do with that?"

1:11:07.219,1:11:13.059
The basic advantage of LFTR over that approach
is we don't form those transuranics. We burn

1:11:13.059,1:11:20.059
up essentially all of the fuel in this process
because we don't remove fuel from the reactor

1:11:20.119,1:11:22.999
until it's a fission product.

1:11:22.999,1:11:27.019
General idea is you don't want uranium, thorium,
or anything else to end up in your waste stream

1:11:27.019,1:11:31.380
and that's a pretty straightforward proposition
in this fluid-fueled reactor. So our waste

1:11:31.380,1:11:37.650
story is a lot different. You can also then
turn around and go back and take some of the

1:11:37.650,1:11:42.840
waste that's already been created in our uranium-fueled
reactors and potentially destroy those long

1:11:42.840,1:11:44.780
lived transuranics through fission.

1:11:44.780,1:11:49.570
Waiting them out to decay is a very slow process.
Plutonium 239, for instance, has a 24,000

1:11:49.570,1:11:52.820
year half-life. That's a long time you're
going to be waiting for that to decay. On

1:11:52.820,1:11:56.530
the other hand, you can fission it and then
those fission products will decay very rapidly

1:11:56.530,1:12:00.230
and you also get an energy release and a neutron
release, both of which are good.

1:12:00.230,1:12:04.190
A thousand kilograms of U-233 is roughly what
we've got. Ninety percent of that'll fission.

1:12:04.190,1:12:09.760
We can make about 500 to $600 million in electricity
and another 50 or $60 million on the fission

1:12:09.760,1:12:15.510
of the uranium-235. Almost all of it will
ultimately end up fissioning. Out of about

1:12:15.510,1:12:20.849
a thousand kilograms, about 15 kilograms of
plutonium-238 will be left over. This is good

1:12:20.849,1:12:27.760
stuff. NASA is desperate for this stuff. Plutonium-238
is different than plutonium-239, the stuff

1:12:27.760,1:12:30.739
we use in bombs. In fact it's worthless for
bombs.

1:12:30.739,1:12:35.219
These radioisotope thermoelectric generators
are based on plutonium-238 and this is the

1:12:35.219,1:12:39.650
only way that we've been able to explore the
outer solar system. The United States is unique.

1:12:39.650,1:12:44.710
It's the only country in the world that has
sent space probes beyond the Asteroid Belt

1:12:44.710,1:12:49.210
and it's all been based on having this technology.
Short answer, we're out of this stuff. It

1:12:49.210,1:12:53.900
's gone. We've used it all up. The Russians
used to sell us some. They've sold us all

1:12:53.900,1:12:55.139
their inventory. It's gone.

1:12:55.139,1:12:59.340
NASA's got billions of dollars of deep space
missions hinging on having enough of this

1:12:59.340,1:13:04.480
stuff to run the batteries to let the thing
call home. We will be able to make this in

1:13:04.480,1:13:08.369
LFTR. If you've heard sometimes about us saying
"We burn up 99 percent of the fuel and there's

1:13:08.369,1:13:14.599
one percent left", the one percent left is
that stuff and it's worth almost as much as

1:13:14.599,1:13:15.670
the stuff we burn up.

1:13:15.670,1:13:18.179
In addition, it would make medical molybdenum-99.

1:13:18.179,1:13:23.360
We are about to shut down the one reactor
in Canada that is making molybdenum-99 for

1:13:23.360,1:13:28.469
medical purposes in 2015. There are hundreds
of thousands of patients that will not be

1:13:28.469,1:13:35.010
able to get their molybdenum-99 that they
need for diagnostic procedures when that happens.

1:13:35.010,1:13:40.179
We can make molybdenum-99 just in normal course
of operation and we can remove it very easily.

1:13:40.179,1:13:46.320
There are four natural decay chains of alpha-emitting
radioisotopes. One starts with U-238, U-235,

1:13:46.320,1:13:53.099
thorium-232, and then there's one that's extinct
because it has no long-lived precursors on

1:13:53.099,1:13:57.550
it. It was there in the supernova billions
of years ago. It's gone now. It's on the U-233

1:13:57.550,1:14:03.079
decay chain. There's a special product on
there, bismuth-213, that could be a smart

1:14:03.079,1:14:07.849
bomb against cancer. They attach the bismuth-213
to an antibody.

1:14:07.849,1:14:12.780
That bismuth only has a half-life of 45 minutes
so it's very radioactive and it's going away

1:14:12.780,1:14:17.980
quickly. But in that time, that antibody can
go and find a cancer cell. The bismuth decays

1:14:17.980,1:14:22.469
and alpha particle goes through the cell,
and it kills the cancer. The radiation technique

1:14:22.469,1:14:27.900
we use in cancer therapy today, they're all
based on beta-emitting isotopes, not on alpha-emitting

1:14:27.900,1:14:34.429
isotopes. They have a big kill radius. They're
not very directable. It's OK, but it's really

1:14:34.429,1:14:35.789
not a smart bomb.

1:14:35.789,1:14:39.920
Alpha-admitting isotopes are really rare.
It's hard to get them. It's hard to get the

1:14:39.920,1:14:44.059
right kind, the right chemical one that will
lock onto the right thing that's close enough

1:14:44.059,1:14:48.249
to being stable that even after it decays,
it doesn't just decay ten more times in the

1:14:48.249,1:14:51.780
body. Bismuth-213 is one decay away from being
done.

1:14:51.780,1:14:57.949
And it's especially good against dispersed
cancers, like leukemia, cancer of the blood.

1:14:57.949,1:15:01.949
Not tumorous cancers, where there's a big
hard lump that you can go in and cut out with

1:15:01.949,1:15:06.639
surgery, but stuff that's hard to get to.
Pancreatic cancer - you get pancreatic cancer,

1:15:06.639,1:15:10.260
you're probably looking at a death sentence,
that's how bad it is.

1:15:10.260,1:15:17.260
Here's the problem, bismuth-213 is unique
in this capability and bismuth-213 can only

1:15:17.730,1:15:19.780
be generated from the decay of Uranium-233.

1:15:19.780,1:15:26.780
I sometimes even lie in bed thinking, if my
kid had leukemia, how hard would I be working

1:15:27.239,1:15:32.510
on getting this therapy ready for them to
save lives and if it's that important, why

1:15:32.510,1:15:34.679
aren't I going full bore on it right now?

1:15:34.679,1:15:36.280
How much did it cost to build?

1:15:36.280,1:15:40.969
What's your ballpark figure? Is this Home
Depot stuff, or...

1:15:40.969,1:15:47.969
No. No, I think a first unit which is probably
going to be on the order of 20/30 megawatts

1:15:48.949,1:15:52.900
electric is - we're looking at several hundred
million dollars to develop that, but then

1:15:52.900,1:15:58.670
taking a step beyond that to utility-class
scale reactor, probably another several hundred

1:15:58.670,1:15:59.369
million dollars.

1:15:59.369,1:16:03.440
You're probably looking at a billion dollars
to bring it up to utility-class, but when

1:16:03.440,1:16:08.550
you consider what it's going to do, that's
really not all that much money. A lot of it

1:16:08.550,1:16:12.719
is the engineering and then the regulation
is a huge question mark.

1:16:12.719,1:16:15.619
It's actually not a lot of money, in a sense.

1:16:15.619,1:16:20.710
I've learned it's not about the number, it's
about the uncertainty on the number. You can

1:16:20.710,1:16:24.460
go to an investment bank right now and you
can say "I want to build and oil drilling

1:16:24.460,1:16:29.449
platform and it's going to cost 12 billion
dollars," and they will write you a check

1:16:29.449,1:16:33.730
for that because you can go and say, "I've
built 50 of these platforms before, here's

1:16:33.730,1:16:37.039
about where the price came out. It's going
to go in this area, which right now is producing

1:16:37.039,1:16:39.949
this much oil, it's going to be out here.
It's going to take this long to recover this

1:16:39.949,1:16:44.489
much oil based on how we've done it the other
50 times." And they go, there's not a lot

1:16:44.489,1:16:46.550
of uncertainty in doing this.

1:16:46.550,1:16:49.260
You start by not making a full LFTR...

1:16:49.260,1:16:49.599
Yes.

1:16:49.599,1:16:53.360
...but making like a little piece. Take some
of these by-products and you use that money

1:16:53.360,1:16:55.920
to get this little first stage that starts
making money...

1:16:55.920,1:16:59.179
Are you sure that we don't have ethernet plugged
into the back of your head somewhere?

1:16:59.179,1:16:59.960
We're doing wireless here. I don't think.

1:16:59.960,1:17:01.010
Could you repeat the question?

1:17:01.010,1:17:01.909
No.

1:17:01.909,1:17:08.909
No. I'm sorry, this question's not covered
by an NDA.

1:17:10.900,1:17:12.269
We got some smart people in this room.

1:17:12.269,1:17:17.420
In aerospace engineering, we were taught to
put development costs and unit costs in the

1:17:17.420,1:17:20.650
separate category. It's like you build a fighter
and you spend billions of dollars to design

1:17:20.650,1:17:25.510
it, but then you run off copies for 20 million
dollars apiece. That's how they build 737s

1:17:25.510,1:17:26.980
or other airplanes.

1:17:26.980,1:17:30.199
If you want to go, "What's the unit cost going
to be?", there's reason to think this is going

1:17:30.199,1:17:35.739
to be a lot less expensive than what we have
today if we set the development in another

1:17:35.739,1:17:35.989
column.

1:17:35.800,1:17:39.329
The reason why, number one, low pressure operation.
That's the biggest one. When you don't have

1:17:39.329,1:17:45.099
to have 96 steel pressure vessels, huge concrete
containments. Number two, you don't have to

1:17:45.099,1:17:48.999
fabricate fuel. You don't have to enrich it.
You don't have to fabricate it and you don't

1:17:48.999,1:17:52.269
have to have the approach to disposal as we
do today.

1:17:52.269,1:17:57.869
Those two features right away are a big deal.
Number three is the safety systems. High pressure,

1:17:57.869,1:18:00.889
water cooler reactors have an abundance of
safety systems designed to always keep the

1:18:00.889,1:18:03.659
core covered with water. So, if one system
has 99 percent reliability; well, you need

1:18:03.659,1:18:08.130
another one that also has it so that you can
get 99.9 and maybe statisticians will get

1:18:08.130,1:18:09.800
mad at me, I might be doing it wrong.

1:18:09.800,1:18:14.369
One of the things that makes the conventional
reactors so expensive the containment vessel

1:18:14.369,1:18:18.969
and you've touched on that. The other is all
the security apparatus around the maintaining

1:18:18.969,1:18:22.929
of the fissile material so that it doesn't
get diverted for military purposes.

1:18:22.929,1:18:27.300
I've scratched my head about that with existing
reactors because our reactors, at least in

1:18:27.300,1:18:29.349
the United States, don't use highly registered
uranium.

1:18:29.349,1:18:33.650
Well, that's one of the fears and that's one
of the security reasons around it. Whether

1:18:33.650,1:18:34.599
it's real or not -

1:18:34.599,1:18:36.989
Yeah, I guess I would have to challenge whether
it's real or not.

1:18:36.989,1:18:40.929
It wasn't that many years ago that we were
able to show parties of visitors around the

1:18:40.929,1:18:45.929
site and actually show them what good condition
the site is in and how safe it is. It's only

1:18:45.929,1:18:51.639
since 9/11 that we've had to stop inviting
visitors. We've always had a very open policy;

1:18:51.639,1:18:55.690
very keen to show people how good we are at
what we do and how safe the plant is. It's

1:18:55.690,1:18:59.940
very difficult to convince yourself that things
are safe because you can't see what's going

1:18:59.940,1:19:00.519
on.

1:19:00.519,1:19:04.130
Even the plutonium inside the reactor is what's
called reactor-grade plutonium, which isn't

1:19:04.130,1:19:04.420
suitable.

1:19:04.420,1:19:08.289
Try going to any facilitate in North America
now, they have SWAT teams and -

1:19:08.289,1:19:12.269
I've toured a nuclear power plant. We've really
got the working when we went in there. I'm

1:19:12.269,1:19:15.869
not exactlysure what the basis of that was,
whether they were worried about theft of fissile

1:19:15.869,1:19:19.920
material - that would be pretty hard. I'd
have to go and depressurize the core, take

1:19:19.920,1:19:24.599
the lid off, get access to all the spent fuel,
somehow remove it from the spent fuel pool

1:19:24.599,1:19:29.429
into some sort of transport cask, take it
off the site to a reprocessing facility that

1:19:29.429,1:19:32.769
doesn't exist and - I mean, I just go "There's
got to be another reason they have all that

1:19:32.769,1:19:33.019
security."

1:19:32.769,1:19:34.010
Watch the TV news.

1:19:34.010,1:19:37.499
Well, you know. It just seems to me, when
there's a subject that I know a little bit

1:19:37.499,1:19:40.489
about and watch how the news covers it, I
get frustrated really quickly.

1:19:40.489,1:19:45.489
I think just about every media outlet I've
seen is drumming up fear. From the New York

1:19:45.489,1:19:47.749
Times to the Huffington Post to the Fox News.

1:19:47.749,1:19:51.079
There's been a recent spike in infant deaths
in Philadelphia and there's one expert right

1:19:51.079,1:19:55.510
now who is saying, "It's radioactive levels
in our water that's to blame for that."

1:19:55.510,1:19:59.510
This has been a very bipartisan approach to
scaring the public.

1:19:59.510,1:20:05.670
Radiation comes across the ocean. It is dissipated
by wind current and salt spray, but it is

1:20:05.670,1:20:08.269
reaching the shore of California.

1:20:08.269,1:20:14.349
There's radiation all over the place, every
single day, but you're talking the damaging

1:20:14.349,1:20:18.900
radiation. That's the thing we're most concerned
about and even in Chernobyl, that didn't get

1:20:18.900,1:20:21.920
to the United States in damaging amounts.
How is it going to do that?

1:20:21.920,1:20:24.570
OK, you know what Bernie. From your mouth,
to God's ears.

1:20:24.570,1:20:29.269
Our media is not built around effectively
and accurately disseminating information to

1:20:29.269,1:20:32.610
the public. Our media is built around...

1:20:32.610,1:20:39.300
Thank you. Our media is built around putting
your eyeballs on their print or on their website

1:20:39.300,1:20:44.929
and keeping them there. The best way to keep
them there is to scare you to death.

1:20:44.929,1:20:51.929
Only 24 hours after the most horrendous tragic,
gargantuan natural disaster of an earthquake

1:20:52.190,1:20:57.249
followed by the tsunami, the only story in
town was about Fukushima.

1:20:57.249,1:21:02.099
As an engineer, we are taught that our responsibility
is to accurately and effectively communicate

1:21:02.099,1:21:06.289
and disseminate information both to other
engineers and to the public at large.

1:21:06.289,1:21:09.670
So an engineer gets on TV and they say, "What's
going to happen, Dr. So-and-So?", and he goes,

1:21:09.670,1:21:13.329
"Well, there's a possibility several things
could happen. A very low probability event

1:21:13.329,1:21:15.960
is that this might happen, but it's much more
likely that --" "Oh, wait. Let's get back

1:21:15.960,1:21:20.010
to that low probability event. Now, in that
low probability event, what could happen?"

1:21:20.010,1:21:23.389
"You know, I guess it's possible that - but
this is really unlikely, and the wind would

1:21:23.389,1:21:27.570
have to blow this way and --" "Well, let's
go that way." The poor engineer, he's thinking

1:21:27.570,1:21:30.369
we're up 10^-12 now, or something like that.

1:21:30.369,1:21:36.249
And they're going, "Does Godzilla form?" "Well,
you know, a double ended DNA break, I suppose

1:21:36.249,1:21:42.030
in the right gene, could actually trigger
an increased growth rate of hormone, which

1:21:42.030,1:21:43.969
could actually lead to mild gigantism."

1:21:43.969,1:21:48.280
They only wanted to know about the risks from
the nuclear incident. And what they particularly

1:21:48.280,1:21:52.719
wanted to know, and asked many times was what
is the worst case scenario.

1:21:52.719,1:21:58.760
Godzilla is coming tomorrow. It's like "Oh
man, we're like 10^-32 at this point. The

1:21:58.760,1:22:02.110
proton is going to decay before this happens."

1:22:02.110,1:22:06.989
You already have a terrible scare story. It
wasn't as if we were asking them to cover

1:22:06.989,1:22:10.550
the good news, not the bad news. There was
plenty of bad news.

1:22:10.550,1:22:14.749
I had a friend of mine. She and her husband
are diplomats in China and she wrote me as

1:22:14.749,1:22:19.210
breathlessly as you can in an email and she
said, "Kirk, are we going to be OK? I'm in

1:22:19.210,1:22:22.199
China, are we going to be all right?" I said,
"Don't worry. The iodine-131 would have to

1:22:22.199,1:22:26.570
blow all the way around the world and then
come back around to get you in China and there

1:22:26.570,1:22:29.039
wouldn't be enough of it, has an eight and
a half day life, so it would have decayed

1:22:29.039,1:22:30.789
to nothing right about here." Blah, blah,
blah.

1:22:30.789,1:22:33.670
But, she was scared to death and this is a
smart girl.

1:22:33.670,1:22:38.719
The Science Media Center's job was to line
up people who know about radiation, who know

1:22:38.719,1:22:43.889
about its affects on humans and without exception,
they said from the beginning, "This is a very,

1:22:43.889,1:22:49.519
very serious incident, but in terms of it
being a threat, even to people in Tokyo, never

1:22:49.519,1:22:55.670
mind to people in Glasgow, they were expressing,
time after time, apart from the people in

1:22:55.670,1:23:01.090
the exclusion zone, that this threat was very,
very, very, very small." And indeed, they

1:23:01.090,1:23:03.469
still feel it is very small.

1:23:03.469,1:23:07.130
Nuclear experts have a vested interest in
playing down nuclear incidents.

1:23:07.130,1:23:12.920
We have journalists coming to us and saying,
"My editor has said to me, what are the apologists

1:23:12.920,1:23:18.050
saying today?" because we were running almost
daily press briefings, with different experts.

1:23:18.050,1:23:22.739
None of them actually worked for industry
as it happened, but yeah, there was this idea,

1:23:22.739,1:23:29.739
that they would say that, wouldn't they? These
leading scientists, who publish and peer-review

1:23:29.869,1:23:36.670
journals, who work for very respected scientific
institutions, are playing down an incident

1:23:36.670,1:23:40.409
because they support the nuclear industry.
That is quite a charge.

1:23:40.409,1:23:47.110
I was just reading an article this morning
saying they detected radioactivity in milk

1:23:47.110,1:23:51.210
and I thought, of course they detected radioactivity
in milk. All milk is radioactive.

1:23:51.210,1:23:57.749
Two of them said, Fiona, our editors think
there is something uniquely terrifying about

1:23:57.749,1:24:04.019
radiation. There is something unique to that
word that has the capacity to really terrify

1:24:04.019,1:24:10.670
people. What a strange set of news values
that what justifies the amount of coverage

1:24:10.670,1:24:13.289
is what your editors feel terrifies people.

1:24:13.289,1:24:17.479
What they really meant to say was there was
a particular radio-isotope they found in the

1:24:17.479,1:24:22.559
milk that came from the Japanese nuclear plant.
The article, of course, didn't mention that,

1:24:22.559,1:24:27.190
which would make people think, "Uh-oh, my
milk has gone from zero radioactivity to some

1:24:27.190,1:24:30.099
radioactivity which must be bad and I must
be in real trouble now."

1:24:30.099,1:24:35.260
The way that this was covered was wrong. I
feel confident in saying that because of how

1:24:35.260,1:24:41.070
many journalists felt uneasy about this. I
know of journalists who were taken off this

1:24:41.070,1:24:45.979
story because what they were writing was too
measured and that's in a really significant,

1:24:45.979,1:24:47.510
major news room in this country.

1:24:47.510,1:24:51.630
In terms of the public's perception of risk,
things that might be true because I read them

1:24:51.630,1:24:56.519
on the Internet, Neil deGrasse Tyson tweeted
today, "the causes of death worldwide in March

1:24:56.519,1:24:59.210
2011, starvation, three million."

1:24:59.210,1:25:03.479
Neil deGrasse Tyson, big fan of his. We've
needed somebody like Neil deGrasse Tyson ever

1:25:03.479,1:25:08.059
since Carl Sagan died. But yeah, what's the
first one on his list, starvation?

1:25:08.059,1:25:13.360
Starvation, 3,000,000; malaria, 250,000; car
crashes, 100,000; quakes and tsunamis 28,000.

1:25:13.360,1:25:17.369
Body count on nuclear power death is what?
Low.

1:25:17.369,1:25:20.889
Civilian nuclear power in the United States
hasn't killed anyone. The body count would

1:25:20.889,1:25:21.420
be zero.

1:25:21.420,1:25:26.639
So when Three Mile Island releases some radiation,
you'd want to incorporate statistic likelihood

1:25:26.639,1:25:29.030
of someone getting thyroid cancer in any number.

1:25:29.030,1:25:33.150
No, because even the statistical likelihood
is theory that is not based on facts. It's

1:25:33.150,1:25:38.159
called the linear no-threshold hypothesis
and it's not based on epidemiological data.

1:25:38.159,1:25:42.729
It's based on the assumption that radiation
will harm you at whatever degree - to whatever

1:25:42.729,1:25:44.289
degree you are exposed.

1:25:44.289,1:25:46.699
I thought that that was established actually.
I thought that...

1:25:46.699,1:25:47.320
No, it's established.

1:25:47.320,1:25:48.309
I've heard that there's...

1:25:48.309,1:25:51.940
It's established policy. That's where that
no such thing as safe radiation - that comes

1:25:51.940,1:25:56.400
from the linear no-threshold hypothesis. It
is established in regulation yet, there's

1:25:56.400,1:26:01.420
no epidemiological data to back that up. There
is no study that says we have taken a cohort

1:26:01.420,1:26:05.269
of people and we have exposed them to one
percent more radiation than normally would

1:26:05.269,1:26:06.920
get and we've seen one percent more cancer.

1:26:06.920,1:26:11.269
In fact, there are many places in the world
where back room levels of radiation are substantially

1:26:11.269,1:26:17.239
higher if the linear no-threshold hypothesis
was in fact true or even approaching truth,

1:26:17.239,1:26:21.719
you would see statistically significantly
higher levels of cancer in those populations,

1:26:21.719,1:26:26.840
those cohorts. But what happens? Not only
is there not higher levels of cancer, there

1:26:26.840,1:26:29.550
are actually suppressed levels of cancer.

1:26:29.550,1:26:34.479
Which leads to a theory that does have substantiation
in the data and that's called hormesis. Hormesis

1:26:34.479,1:26:38.260
is simply a little bit is good for you and
radiation appears to be one of these things

1:26:38.260,1:26:42.999
where a little bit more is actually good for
you and suppresses your development of cancer.

1:26:42.999,1:26:45.969
And I say, well why would a little bit of
radiation be good for me? When you go and

1:26:45.969,1:26:49.369
exercise, you damage your muscles, but your
body rebuilds them and rebuilds them stronger

1:26:49.369,1:26:53.809
than they were before. Radiation stimulates
cellular damage, but it also stimulates the

1:26:53.809,1:26:55.289
body's repair mechanism.

1:26:55.289,1:26:59.420
If hormesis became policy instead of linear
no-threshold, we would have an incredibly

1:26:59.420,1:27:03.989
different approach to radiation. In fact,
in some ways, we actually do accept hormesis

1:27:03.989,1:27:07.469
when it comes to natural radiation, but we
don't accept it when it comes to artificial

1:27:07.469,1:27:09.999
radiation. The reality is, there's no difference
between the two.

1:27:09.999,1:27:14.800
We have a three year environmental assessment
process in Canada to build a nuclear reactor

1:27:14.800,1:27:16.300
and we have a weekend to produce a coal plant.

1:27:16.300,1:27:20.739
Coal and gas plants are able to release radioactive
materials into the environments in much greater

1:27:20.739,1:27:25.559
amounts than a nuclear plant would ever possibly
be allowed to because they are considered

1:27:25.559,1:27:29.489
what's called NORM, Natural Occurring Radioactive
Materials. For instance, when you go frack

1:27:29.489,1:27:34.179
a shale and you pull gas out, a lot of radon
comes out with that too.

1:27:34.179,1:27:39.749
You burn the gas, that radon's being released.
Nobody counts that radon against the gas.

1:27:39.749,1:27:44.539
If they did, the regulatory commission would
shut the gas plant down, same with coal. Coal

1:27:44.539,1:27:47.769
contains small amounts of uranium and thorium.
They go up the stack, they're dispersed.

1:27:47.769,1:27:50.369
That's why they can't tell you how much waste
they produced.

1:27:50.369,1:27:55.130
Yeah, and they spend a lot of money to make
sure that regulatory agencies do not regulate

1:27:55.130,1:28:00.900
NORM for a coal or gas plant the way they
regulate radioactive emissions from a nuclear

1:28:00.900,1:28:06.070
plant. If they did, we would be shutting down
all of our coal and gas plants based on radioactivity

1:28:06.070,1:28:07.479
alone.

1:28:07.479,1:28:10.670
Even if linear no-threshold was actually true
- let's say for a minute it was true, and

1:28:10.670,1:28:15.249
this was the reality of the world. You would
still be much better off establishing an entire

1:28:15.249,1:28:18.739
world powered by nuclear power. The reason
why is because of the radioactive releases

1:28:18.739,1:28:22.440
from coal. You would want to shut down coal
so you could have nuclear, because coal releases

1:28:22.440,1:28:25.679
more radiation than nuclear by several orders
of magnitude.

1:28:25.679,1:28:32.130
The notion that there is no safe amount of
radiation is not a substantiated or even an

1:28:32.130,1:28:38.469
accurate statement. It is probably actually
utterly inaccurate. But, it is commonly found

1:28:38.469,1:28:41.639
as a basis of public policy around the world.

1:28:41.639,1:28:46.800
That was my understanding until just now,
that there was no safe level of radiation.

1:28:46.800,1:28:50.510
Two great books on this- "Terrestrial Energy"
by Bill Tucker, and "The Power to Save the

1:28:50.510,1:28:57.070
World" by Gwen Cravens- go into this topic
extensively. Until this notion of low exposure

1:28:57.070,1:29:03.670
levels of radiation is addressed and put to
bed, it will forever dog the nuclear industry.

1:29:03.670,1:29:07.760
A sunburn is radiation damage. That's radiation
burn. We don't call it that, but that's what

1:29:07.760,1:29:13.499
it is. Your body is responding, trying to
prevent further radiation damage, ionizing

1:29:13.499,1:29:16.780
radiation to your skin and your cells, and
it's generating melanin, which is a natural

1:29:16.780,1:29:18.519
shielding mechanism.

1:29:18.519,1:29:22.229
You don't want to let anybody get too much
radiation dose at any one time and the radioactivity

1:29:22.229,1:29:26.760
that we get from nuclear reactors is extremely
small in comparison to the radioactivity we're

1:29:26.760,1:29:30.659
getting from other sources. The biggest one
being radon. There's a radioactive gas that's

1:29:30.659,1:29:34.760
coming out of the ground all the time. You're
breathing it right now. It is responsible

1:29:34.760,1:29:40.479
by far for the majority of the radioactivity
that your body receives. It's just the planet

1:29:40.479,1:29:41.829
we live on.

1:29:41.829,1:29:45.159
Inside the earth, thorium and uranium are
decaying, and they're decaying very slowly,

1:29:45.159,1:29:50.070
but there's a lot of them and the earth is
big. They produce most of the heat that drives

1:29:50.070,1:29:54.030
the internal processes of the earth. They
produce the heat that drives plate tectonics,

1:29:54.030,1:29:58.510
and they produce the heat that drives the
generation of the magnetic field. If we didn't

1:29:58.510,1:30:02.340
have the energy from thorium, we wouldn't
have carbon recycling in the crust.

1:30:02.340,1:30:07.010
A bigger deal is the magnetic field, because
the magnetic field is deflecting the solar

1:30:07.010,1:30:11.900
wind. If you don't have a magnetic field deflecting
the solar wind, over billions of years your

1:30:11.900,1:30:17.489
planet ends up like Mars. Because the solar
wind will strip off a planet's atmosphere

1:30:17.489,1:30:22.909
without the protecting nature of the magnetic
field. So if we didn't have the energy from

1:30:22.909,1:30:26.340
thorium inside the earth, we would be on a
dead planet.

1:30:26.340,1:30:28.309
A fun thing I tell people, I say, "What's
green energy?" They go, "Geothermal is green

1:30:28.309,1:30:33.340
energy." Do you know where geothermal comes
from? No. It comes from decay of Thorium inside

1:30:33.340,1:30:37.780
the earth. Is geothermal renewable? Yes! OK,
then Thorium is renewable. "No, it's not,

1:30:37.780,1:30:40.550
you're using it up!" Well, you're using up
Thorium as it decays inside the earth, too.

1:30:40.550,1:30:45.929
So any argument for geothermal, if it is rigorously
pursued, is an argument for the renewability

1:30:45.929,1:30:49.739
of thorium as an energy resource. And I love
to have that debate. They usually change the

1:30:49.739,1:30:51.280
rules on me as I get into it.

1:30:51.280,1:30:56.369
But a good one to play on your friends if
they start giving you a hard time for coming

1:30:56.369,1:31:00.829
to protospace and talking about Thorium, you
say, "Dude, it's green energy." "What!?"

1:31:00.829,1:31:05.139
If you're concerned with the environment,
then you want to be aware of what the power

1:31:05.139,1:31:11.139
density of any source is. Anybody who's trying
to sell you biofuels, or this kind of thing,

1:31:11.139,1:31:16.260
what do you do about the thermodynamic inefficiency
of combustion engines? Fuels, that you burn,

1:31:16.260,1:31:22.289
is down in here. Whenever we burn something,
we're using a very inefficient process. Thermodynamics

1:31:22.289,1:31:26.710
typically gives us about 30 percent of the
energy when we burn fuel.

1:31:26.710,1:31:31.369
So every time you put a dollar's worth of
gas in your car, kiss 60 cents goodbye, because

1:31:31.369,1:31:35.639
it's going to go out of the exhaust pipe as
heat. And we waste 10 percent of what's generated

1:31:35.639,1:31:39.699
in transmission lines. So whenever they talk
about these remote solar farms, or remote

1:31:39.699,1:31:43.210
wind farms or anything, you have a debt of
10 percent that you're paying from now on,

1:31:43.210,1:31:45.820
forever. You're never going to get that energy
back.

1:31:45.820,1:31:51.820
Five megawatt, top of the line Siemens wind
mill, takes 10 acres. And five megawatts per

1:31:51.820,1:31:56.389
10 acres, that's half a megawatt per acre.
If you move up to fission, you got hundreds

1:31:56.389,1:32:02.229
of thousands more watts per square foot, per
acre, per pound. Whatever. And if you move

1:32:02.229,1:32:08.519
up to fusion, you get another 10,000 times
that. Fusion we don't have to wait for, because

1:32:08.519,1:32:12.010
fission is good enough for us, particularly
with the thorium cycle.

1:32:12.010,1:32:16.409
A nuclear article would be written. Author
of the article will go to me, or Rod Adams,

1:32:16.409,1:32:20.949
or John Wheeler - somebody who's kind of known
as a public advocate for nuclear. And then

1:32:20.949,1:32:25.389
to go find the other side, Ed Lyman, or Jim
Riccio of Greenpeace, or one of these other

1:32:25.389,1:32:29.110
guys. Now contrast this with an article around
solar, or wind, and I look for this all the

1:32:29.110,1:32:33.389
time. I'm always trying to see, is there another
side in those articles? There's never another

1:32:33.389,1:32:36.979
side. "Such and such a company has announced
they're going to put 50 megawatts of windmills

1:32:36.979,1:32:39.659
in this site. World rejoices."

1:32:39.659,1:32:42.159
And they've chewed up half the mountain to
put the windmills up there.

1:32:42.159,1:32:46.389
They get more subsidies per megawatt hour
than any other form of energy by one or two

1:32:46.389,1:32:51.949
orders of magnitude. I mean, it is huge! We're
offering to buy back solar energy from people

1:32:51.949,1:32:57.400
who produce it at 35 to 50 cents a kilowatt
hour. I mean, that's obscene. Why on Earth,

1:32:57.400,1:33:00.960
if you're making energy at your home, you
should sell it back to the grid at whatever

1:33:00.960,1:33:05.260
the grid is buying at that time. The grid
should not have to buy energy from you at

1:33:05.260,1:33:06.989
some massively increased price.

1:33:06.989,1:33:09.400
But they're subsidizing technology until it
gets more efficient.

1:33:09.400,1:33:12.409
When all of these tariffs are reduced, the
things that we're supposed to encourage, and

1:33:12.409,1:33:17.179
jump start an industry, the industry collapses.
Solar industry in Germany and in Spain is

1:33:17.179,1:33:21.739
in utter collapse because of the projected
removal of fees and tariffs because these

1:33:21.739,1:33:26.300
are simply not economical sources of energy.
The subsidy may be well intentioned to try

1:33:26.300,1:33:30.260
to get the industry to get going on its own
but that's usually not the way things work.

1:33:30.260,1:33:34.539
Every energy source is subsidized, right?
If oil is subsidized because we're sending

1:33:34.539,1:33:35.869
people off to war...

1:33:35.869,1:33:41.059
The levels of the subsidies are substantially
lower for established industries than they

1:33:41.059,1:33:42.909
are for things like solar and wind.

1:33:42.909,1:33:46.769
George Monbiot, who writes in The Guardian,
he has recently come out very strongly in

1:33:46.769,1:33:50.280
support of nuclear power because of what happened
at Fukushima Daiichi, how if survived the

1:33:50.280,1:33:54.510
earthquake and the overall effect has been
nothing compared to the death and loss of

1:33:54.510,1:33:55.559
life from the tsunami.

1:33:55.559,1:33:59.199
Well, he mentioned in an article that he wrote
yesterday that he talked to Caroline Lucas,

1:33:59.199,1:34:04.300
the head of the green party in the U.K. And
he asked her why she would support subsidies

1:34:04.300,1:34:07.579
on solar and wind. She goes "I oppose subsides
for nuclear but I support them for solar and

1:34:07.579,1:34:11.340
wind because nuclear is an established industry
and solar and wind are still developing industries,

1:34:11.340,1:34:15.960
and they need public support in order to flourish."
And so George, a very smart guy, said "Will

1:34:15.960,1:34:20.889
you support research into thorium reactors,
which could provide a much safer and cheaper

1:34:20.889,1:34:23.670
means of producing nuclear power?"

1:34:23.670,1:34:28.460
No, because thorium reactors are not a proven
technology.

1:34:28.460,1:34:32.749
On an individual level we are seeing a lot
of people change their minds. But at the organizational

1:34:32.749,1:34:38.030
level we're not seeing any change. The people
who run the environmentalist organizations,

1:34:38.030,1:34:38.280
and that's unfortunate.

1:34:38.130,1:34:43.209
Have you had a one-on-one where you are talking
to someone and they get this?

1:34:43.209,1:34:47.300
It's tough for people who are further up the
food chain in these organizations to come

1:34:47.300,1:34:51.959
out and make public policy statements. A lot
of people get it one-on-one but they're afraid

1:34:51.959,1:34:56.920
to be the first one to stand up and say "Ra-ra-ra,
let's go do this." It's a lot easier when

1:34:56.920,1:34:58.789
you feel like everybody else is behind you.

1:34:58.789,1:35:04.249
Why are appeals to technological advancements
always made with regards to solar and wind?

1:35:04.249,1:35:07.159
It's going to get better it's going to get
cheaper, it's going to get more efficient.

1:35:07.159,1:35:10.719
Don't worry about what we have now, cause
it's going to be better next year. But yet

1:35:10.719,1:35:14.869
nuclear is assigned this position back in
the '50s where it can never get better, it

1:35:14.869,1:35:19.289
can never incorporate a new technology, it
can never improve and we won't even entertain

1:35:19.289,1:35:20.840
if it does get any better.

1:35:20.840,1:35:25.719
Nuclear right now means water cooled reactor,
uranium oxide solid fuel, poor fuel efficiency

1:35:25.719,1:35:31.510
and steam turbine. That's what nuclear power
means right now. So people look at Fukushima

1:35:31.510,1:35:37.789
Daiichi and they go, "Is this the end of nuclear
power?" and I go, "No, it's not the end of

1:35:37.789,1:35:39.300
nuclear power, there's a zillion other ways
to do nuclear power."

1:35:39.300,1:35:44.190
The reactor that we worked on is cooled by
a liquid salt, a nuclear fuel in the form

1:35:44.190,1:35:45.429
of solid pebbles.

1:35:45.429,1:35:50.739
They're cooled by fluoride salts, but the
fuel is not dissolved in the salts, it's in

1:35:50.739,1:35:51.809
a solid form.

1:35:51.809,1:35:56.690
I was invited to the director's office. The
physicist there telling me, "What you have

1:35:56.690,1:36:02.579
invented is a new thorium uranium-233 breeder."
Have you ever heard of about EXYDER, of course

1:36:02.579,1:36:02.969
not.

1:36:02.969,1:36:07.659
Just imagine what would happen if there was
a light water reactor where the nuclear steam

1:36:07.659,1:36:14.449
supply system was in a single vessel, no piping
penetrations in excess of about three inches

1:36:14.449,1:36:17.570
in diameter. I'm working on that exact reactor.

1:36:17.570,1:36:22.829
From their reaction to Fukushima, it was an
indication that people didn't understand the

1:36:22.829,1:36:29.780
options around nuclear. Updating the old infrastructure
will increase the safety standards significantly.

1:36:29.780,1:36:36.159
Generation two and three are still operational,
generation 3.5 is what's being built right

1:36:36.159,1:36:40.869
now and generation four has higher safety
standards, easier to build and so cheaper

1:36:40.869,1:36:46.150
to build better fuel utilization, drastically
cheaper energy, even safer reactors.

1:36:46.150,1:36:50.570
Maybe there's a better way, if you can figure
out how to do this better, I will be happy

1:36:50.570,1:36:54.209
to get off LFTR and go do whatever that is
better. This is the best way I've be able

1:36:54.209,1:36:55.499
to come up with so far.

1:36:55.499,1:36:57.449
Can you do a recap on what the study said?

1:36:57.449,1:37:01.190
The title of the study was "Thorium was no
panacea for nuclear energy." They were trying

1:37:01.190,1:37:03.190
to point out the deficiencies in thorium.

1:37:03.190,1:37:09.829
I didn't think they were applying a very fair
logic to it because they would say "Thorium

1:37:09.829,1:37:14.070
in a solid fuel reactor would do blah blah
blah. See that's not very good so thorium's

1:37:14.070,1:37:14.320
dumb."

1:37:14.119,1:37:17.820
Well no, thorium's dumb in a solid fuel reactor.
Not "thorium's dumb."

1:37:17.820,1:37:23.579
If you're going go out there try to put something
out to the public saying "I'm going to authoritatively

1:37:23.579,1:37:28.440
refute the use of thorium as an energy source,"
then it behooves you to do your homework.

1:37:28.440,1:37:30.880
Is it safe as it sounds what's preventing
North American governments from actually creating

1:37:30.880,1:37:37.880
the reactor? What's the scary thing about
it?

1:37:38.579,1:37:43.050
Ah, you're thinking like me 10 years ago,
you're looking for a reason why not, I don't

1:37:43.050,1:37:46.989
think there is a reason why not. There may
be a reason why they may not be excited to

1:37:46.989,1:37:47.590
do it.

1:37:47.590,1:37:49.360
But there's no reason why they can't do it.

1:37:49.360,1:37:55.659
If I'm a company that's building CANDUs or
light-water reactors, what competitive advantage

1:37:55.659,1:37:59.900
do I have by pursuing this other direction?
Probably don't have any.

1:37:59.900,1:38:03.570
There's such a thing as nuclear hacking, it's
what this whole thing is about, because we're

1:38:03.570,1:38:09.429
not talking about nuclear technology the way
it's done now, we're talking about a completely

1:38:09.429,1:38:11.690
different approach to nuclear energy.

1:38:11.690,1:38:15.940
So maybe we'll look back in the future and
it's meetings and gatherings like this we'll

1:38:15.940,1:38:19.449
go "Man, that was where it got started. It
didn't get started at Westinghouse or Atomic

1:38:19.449,1:38:24.909
Energy of Canada, or GE," there's a ton we
could do in this reactor that would even involve

1:38:24.909,1:38:29.400
the radioactive materials. All the stuff like
the power conversion system all the chemistry,

1:38:29.400,1:38:31.309
that could all be done non-nuclear.

1:38:31.309,1:38:37.249
I don't have a lot of faith that the current
nuclear institutions, to be honest, what exactly

1:38:37.249,1:38:41.289
do we want from them? I mean all of their
technology is based around technology that

1:38:41.289,1:38:43.039
isn't what's going to go into this machine.

1:38:43.039,1:38:47.739
We want the fact they have the ear of governments
and very large banks.

1:38:47.739,1:38:51.829
OK, how many- we're not exactly building lots
of nuclear reactors right now. All their money

1:38:51.829,1:38:56.690
now is coming off fuel supply contracts. That's
how GE and Westinghouse make money on nuclear

1:38:56.690,1:39:01.329
power today, they don't build reactors, they
sell fuel. Now 30 years ago they were building

1:39:01.329,1:39:04.889
reactors, but that's not really going on right
now.

1:39:04.889,1:39:10.030
So their business model is overwhelmingly
dominated by fuel fabrications. Come on now

1:39:10.030,1:39:14.539
you say, "Guess what I got a reactor it's
got no fuel fabrication to it," you just upended

1:39:14.539,1:39:15.260
their business model.

1:39:15.260,1:39:19.489
In the United States we're building two reactors
right now. We're going to shut down more reactors

1:39:19.489,1:39:24.590
than that in a few years. We're not getting
ahead of anything, we'll be lucky to hold

1:39:24.590,1:39:27.329
the line. I don't even think we're going to
be able to do that.

1:39:27.329,1:39:29.880
What about in developing countries like China
and India?

1:39:29.880,1:39:33.690
China's ripping it up, China's building like
50 reactors right now.

1:39:33.690,1:39:39.170
But even China's realized, "We can't built
reactors based around water cooling and uranium

1:39:39.170,1:39:43.889
oxide fuel, it's not going last that long."
China's doing LFTR, even as we speak.

1:39:43.889,1:39:45.709
I found that ago a few months ago.

1:39:45.709,1:39:48.579
Where are they getting the blueprints? Or
are they developing them?

1:39:48.579,1:39:55.300
Well, I mean they've probably got a whole
bunch of stuff from the PDFs on my website.

1:39:55.300,1:40:00.670
It's been in the public domain for an awful
long time. I just made it a little easier

1:40:00.670,1:40:01.699
to get.

1:40:01.699,1:40:05.670
This was about 10 years ago. I got in the
car, I lived in Alabama and I was able to

1:40:05.670,1:40:08.909
go up to Oak Ridge then talk to some of the
people there. And I said "Hey, I've heard

1:40:08.909,1:40:13.909
that you guys long time ago did this really,
really cool thing. What's going on?" and they're

1:40:13.909,1:40:17.360
like "Yeah, long time ago we did a really,
really cool thing and everybody that did it

1:40:17.360,1:40:18.320
is either retired or dead now."

1:40:18.320,1:40:22.199
I'm like "Oh, well, that's not good. What
can we do?" and they said "Well, they wrote

1:40:22.199,1:40:27.119
a lot of papers and they wrote a lot of reports."
I said "Oh, OK. Can I get them?" "Oh yeah"

1:40:27.119,1:40:31.729
then they took me to this file cabinet and
it was like full of stuff. And PDF'd - not

1:40:31.729,1:40:33.889
everything but most of it, about two-thirds
of it.

1:40:33.889,1:40:40.030
So, I had this stack of CD's and I thought
"Oh!" Send a copy to the Secretary of Energy,

1:40:40.030,1:40:44.530
send a copy to the Director of National Labs,
send it all out to these different places

1:40:44.530,1:40:50.409
just sure they were going to get CDs from
a random person and put them in their computer

1:40:50.409,1:40:55.179
and study them extensively - all five Gigabytes
of them - and come to the same conclusion

1:40:55.179,1:41:00.650
I had and change national policy. I mean,
of course, right? If we do not get this message

1:41:00.650,1:41:04.869
out to everyone, then nothing's going to change.

1:41:04.869,1:41:10.039
In early 2010 EFT bloggers noticed that all
these guys who were trying signing up from

1:41:10.039,1:41:13.769
Shanghai, Beijing and they started asking
questions about this and that.

1:41:13.769,1:41:17.780
They went to Oak Ridge. They took them around
the lab and showed them everything. And it's

1:41:17.780,1:41:21.619
funny going to Oak Ridge because they're all
about the info and the nano and the bio and

1:41:21.619,1:41:25.139
you want to go, "What about the nuclear?"
They never talk about that part. Well, we

1:41:25.139,1:41:29.420
get to the end of the trip and the Chinese
official's name was Dr. Jiang Mianheng...

1:41:29.420,1:41:32.979
interesting about Dr. Jiang Mianheng, his
father was Jiang Zemin, who used to be the

1:41:32.979,1:41:38.300
premier of China. So, this is not a poorly-placed
guy in Chinese society.

1:41:38.300,1:41:40.280
Trained in the United States in Pennsylvania.

1:41:40.280,1:41:43.989
PhD in Electrical Engineer from Drexel University;
very, very bright guy.

1:41:43.989,1:41:46.289
They were under a non-disclosure agreement
between RGOE and the Chinese government.

1:41:46.289,1:41:49.579
So they get to the end of the meeting and
I'm told by Oak Ridge people "You know we

1:41:49.579,1:41:54.249
had this great trip. Have you learned what
you wanted to learn?" and they go "We're actually

1:41:54.249,1:41:58.139
here to learn about the molten salt reactor.
You see, we're going to build one - we've

1:41:58.139,1:42:01.070
already got a site picked out - and we're
going to have it built by 2020 and we're here

1:42:01.070,1:42:06.340
to learn everything we can about it." And
in Oak Ridge we were like "Huh..."

1:42:06.340,1:42:09.559
Anybody have their earphones in their ears
while I've been talking to try and drown me

1:42:09.559,1:42:14.639
out? Older folks like me will recall a day
when earphones didn't look like that. The

1:42:14.639,1:42:19.459
whole trick has been the invention of a little
magnet based on neodymium, neodymium-iron-boron

1:42:19.459,1:42:23.590
magnets. Extremely powerful magnets, and they
use a rare earth mineral called neodymium.

1:42:23.590,1:42:29.440
And because neodymium-iron-boron magnets are
so powerful one of the places they find application

1:42:29.440,1:42:32.909
is in the generators that sit on top of windmills.

1:42:32.909,1:42:37.869
Global demand for wind has really increased
desire to find neodymium.

1:42:37.869,1:42:41.780
Currently it's all being mined in China. Now
why am I talking about neodymium?

1:42:41.780,1:42:46.309
Well, because thorium is always found with
heavy rare earth elements. If you remember

1:42:46.309,1:42:49.519
your periodic table, the lanthanides that
column above the actinides, those are all

1:42:49.519,1:42:50.539
the rare earths.

1:42:50.539,1:42:56.389
Thorium policy in all western nations undermines
the successful development of a domestic rare

1:42:56.389,1:43:00.039
earth market. All of the rare earths that
most western mining companies are willing

1:43:00.039,1:43:05.510
to process are what they call bastnasites
or carbonatites. They typically select these

1:43:05.510,1:43:10.989
rare earths not because of the high ratios
of rare earths but simply the absence of thorium.

1:43:10.989,1:43:16.599
So consequently the only operating rare earth
mine that just opened up this year, according

1:43:16.599,1:43:22.599
to their own filings in the USGS, produces
essentially the lighter half of the lanthanide

1:43:22.599,1:43:28.449
scale and in fact does have some monazites,
which are a thorium rare earth enriched mineralization,

1:43:28.449,1:43:29.719
which they dispose of.

1:43:29.719,1:43:35.329
So what happens all across America, Canada,
and South America, there are beautiful monazite

1:43:35.329,1:43:39.849
deposits that have heavy rare earths which
could be very commercial except for the thorium

1:43:39.849,1:43:40.209
content.

1:43:40.209,1:43:45.809
Mountain Pass was originally closed, according
to CEO Mark Smith, because of the EPA and

1:43:45.809,1:43:50.530
the state of California and some thorium that
came out of a ruptured tailing site. Thorium

1:43:50.530,1:43:56.920
represents this unknown and unlimited liability
to rare earth production, so it plays into

1:43:56.920,1:43:58.150
the hands of China.

1:43:58.150,1:44:03.380
First, China provided rare earth elements
very cheaply to everybody in the world by

1:44:03.380,1:44:08.809
their cheap labor, lack of enforceable environmental
regulations, and their appreciate currency.

1:44:08.809,1:44:12.559
Essentially, consolidate and control the rare
earth market.

1:44:12.559,1:44:17.559
And then they said, "Well, now all of you
are coming to our door to buy our rare earths.

1:44:17.559,1:44:22.209
We don't want to sell the raw material anymore.
Our manufacturers can buy it cheaper."

1:44:22.209,1:44:28.909
They impose a huge export tax on rare earth
elements. So, one had a choice to accept a

1:44:28.909,1:44:35.300
huge tax and an increase in the price of the
product or relocate factory into mainland

1:44:35.300,1:44:40.440
China and buy rare earth elements on the local
market without tax.

1:44:40.440,1:44:43.619
It's a strategy and it's working pretty well.

1:44:43.619,1:44:47.949
Manufacturers which use rare earth elements
in their products relocated their manufacturing

1:44:47.949,1:44:53.349
base inside China. The jobs in manufacturing
transferred from the United States and western

1:44:53.349,1:44:55.489
Europe into the Chinese mainland.

1:44:55.489,1:45:00.440
They've moved all the way up the value chain
and are actually able to leverage their position

1:45:00.440,1:45:06.849
into capturing other countries I.P. If Toyota
really wants to build a million battery packs,

1:45:06.849,1:45:11.369
in the end, if they don't find a solution
to the heavy rare earth problem, they'll be

1:45:11.369,1:45:12.380
building them inside China.

1:45:12.380,1:45:18.840
So what we need to be able to do is let another
entity take that thorium, develop uses and

1:45:18.840,1:45:20.309
markets, including energy.

1:45:20.309,1:45:24.519
So, let's say, for example, you've got a single
rare earth refinery creating about 20,000

1:45:24.519,1:45:29.300
tons of heavy rare earths a year. On current
consumption, that's about 130 percent of domestic

1:45:29.300,1:45:34.400
consumption for rare earths. That automatically
undermines China's advantage. Now, there's

1:45:34.400,1:45:38.829
two places on the planet Earth where you have
a guaranteed supply of heavy rare earths.

1:45:38.829,1:45:43.849
What can your country leverage that into?
This is the fulcrum you need to get back into

1:45:43.849,1:45:46.099
the world economy as a manufacturer.

1:45:46.099,1:45:50.749
Since 99 percent of the rare earths that we
use, including those magnets? Well, when those

1:45:50.749,1:45:53.709
got mined, there was probably some thorium
that came up with it that's probably sitting

1:45:53.709,1:46:00.709
in some barrels over in China right now, waiting
for Dr. Jhang to finish his experiments with

1:46:00.900,1:46:03.829
thorium molten salt reactors and to start
putting them to use.

1:46:03.829,1:46:07.999
This is the most important thing that's going
to happen in the next 24 months, and whoever

1:46:07.999,1:46:13.309
gets that is essentially going to control
the destiny and the roll out of energy for

1:46:13.309,1:46:14.539
the foreseeable future.

1:46:14.539,1:46:19.119
They need to be able to realize the promise
of thorium. But, I'd also like to see us succeed,

1:46:19.119,1:46:24.199
you know? We were working on this stuff a
long time ago, we made great progress on it.

1:46:24.199,1:46:29.659
We set it down in 1974 for kind of dumb reasons,
and I think it's high time that we picked

1:46:29.659,1:46:31.789
that thread back up again.

1:46:31.789,1:46:36.479
Energy seems to correlate with influence.
People who have energy, which used to be the

1:46:36.479,1:46:41.329
U.S., we had a lot of influence, now, there
are others who have a lot of energy, and they

1:46:41.329,1:46:42.639
seem to be gaining influence.

1:46:42.639,1:46:47.579
The real question is whether the U.S. is missing
a strategic national security opportunity.

1:46:47.579,1:46:52.039
We can either be on the wagon or we can buy
foreign reactors in the future.

1:46:52.039,1:46:56.979
The worldwide energy business is about a three
trillion dollar a year business. And an awful

1:46:56.979,1:47:03.979
lot of folks' wealth and power rides on the
business of moving large amounts of hydro-carbon

1:47:04.019,1:47:06.059
from one place to another.

1:47:06.059,1:47:12.070
You're on a billion, million dollar idea here.
And to switch over from fuels like oil, gas,

1:47:12.070,1:47:17.940
uranium, do you worry that might be a possible
problem?

1:47:17.940,1:47:24.400
I'm a lot more worried about someday looking
at our descendants and have them say, "Why

1:47:24.400,1:47:28.570
did you give us this world that we have now?
Why did you give us this world of energy poverty,

1:47:28.570,1:47:34.389
of pollution, of war, of disease, when you
knew there was a better way and you could

1:47:34.389,1:47:37.260
have made it happen? Why didn't you do it?"

1:47:37.260,1:47:41.059
That's the same question we'd ask these guys
if we could go back to 1969, right? "Why didn't

1:47:41.059,1:47:45.300
you do this? You knew about it, you could
have made it happen, but you didn't. What's

1:47:45.300,1:47:46.420
your excuse?"

1:47:46.420,1:47:50.690
Human beings have been superstitious and fearful
for most of their history. An era of enlightenment

1:47:50.690,1:47:55.380
has been a relatively short space of human
history, and by no means assured that it will

1:47:55.380,1:47:56.789
continue in that manner.

1:47:56.789,1:48:02.079
I really believe that if we don't have access
to affordable and clean energy, we will revert.

1:48:02.079,1:48:05.130
We will go back to the way humans had been
for thousands and thousands of years, which

1:48:05.130,1:48:10.510
is where the powerful and the rich oppress
the masses, who lived terrible lives trying

1:48:10.510,1:48:13.260
to provide things for just a few people.

1:48:13.260,1:48:19.639
We will literally not only revert to barbarism
but revert to social institutions like slavery.

1:48:19.639,1:48:21.369
And I mean that with all seriousness.

1:48:21.369,1:48:24.349
You only have a limited amount of money, you
want to reduce greenhouse gases, so you want

1:48:24.349,1:48:29.059
to apply the dollars in ways that reduce greenhouse
gases the most while creating the most employment

1:48:29.059,1:48:30.519
possible for that investment.

1:48:30.519,1:48:35.380
But, all the jobs that they create have to
be built into the price of the power they

1:48:35.380,1:48:38.699
provide. Yeah, it would provide a lot of jobs
but it's at the expense of the people that

1:48:38.699,1:48:39.860
use the energy.

1:48:39.860,1:48:44.860
If we can provide an energy source cheaper
than from coal, all the nations, in their

1:48:44.860,1:48:49.260
own economic self-interest, will choose it
over coal.

1:48:49.260,1:48:51.349
Nuclear energy is not terribly reliable.

1:48:51.349,1:48:55.550
It's a turbine that we just take from a gas
plant and suspend it from a big scaffolding,

1:48:55.550,1:49:01.320
a tower, and surround it by giant mirrors
in the desert. If a cloud passes over, or

1:49:01.320,1:49:06.340
during the evening, the utility wants a base
load. And the way that we're going to deliver

1:49:06.340,1:49:10.940
that base load is by powering it with gas.
We're building these all over the country,

1:49:10.940,1:49:16.309
and one of the questions we ask, we need about
3,000 foot in altitude. We need flat land,

1:49:16.309,1:49:20.949
we need 300 days of sunlight, and we need
to be near a gas pipe.

1:49:20.949,1:49:22.439
Hugely expensive capital costs.

1:49:22.439,1:49:26.979
Here are four independent proposals to build
molten salt reactors and their dates. The

1:49:26.979,1:49:28.559
median is $1.98.

1:49:28.559,1:49:34.079
You look at a LFTR for one to two dollars
a watt, you're looking at a full cost there,

1:49:34.079,1:49:38.739
because the fuel cost is so close to zero
that you can safely ignore it.

1:49:38.739,1:49:40.670
Nuclear energy only produces electricity.

1:49:40.670,1:49:45.610
Now all our reactors today use steam turbines.
Now we don't use that because we're stupid,

1:49:45.610,1:49:51.010
we use it because the limitations of pressurized
water mean that you can't get it all that

1:49:51.010,1:49:53.150
hot. I mean, the reactor just doesn't get
that hot.

1:49:53.150,1:49:58.219
With this reactor, we can get up to more like
700 or 800C, and at those temperatures, the

1:49:58.219,1:50:02.420
gas turbine turns out to be a better fit.
So you can generate electricity from the gas

1:50:02.420,1:50:06.469
turbine, and you've got to cool the gas, and
every thermodynamic cycle has to reject waste

1:50:06.469,1:50:07.090
heat.

1:50:07.090,1:50:10.630
Almost no economic penalty to desalinate sea
water.

1:50:10.630,1:50:15.670
Or we might try to synthesize fuel. We can
configure it, not to produce electricity,

1:50:15.670,1:50:20.570
but to dissociate water. You can make ammonia
out of hydrogen, which could be a fuel. It's

1:50:20.570,1:50:25.170
also a fertilizer. Ammonia production consumes
more than one percent of the entire world

1:50:25.170,1:50:26.610
energy budget today.

1:50:26.610,1:50:30.229
It's about 14 years from when you put the
project forward to when it's built, and it's

1:50:30.229,1:50:31.849
famous for cost overruns.

1:50:31.849,1:50:37.959
We used to build small reactors in a short
period of time. May of 1961, Congress funded

1:50:37.959,1:50:39.550
Camp Century in Greenland.

1:50:39.550,1:50:44.610
The assembly is still subcritical. We began
to transfer the fuel elements one by one,

1:50:44.610,1:50:46.559
and started loading the reactor core.

1:50:46.559,1:50:50.489
The reactor was operating under the ice 18
months later.

1:50:50.489,1:50:56.039
The Brayton cycle uses an inert gas, so you
don't have to worry about fuel explosions,

1:50:56.039,1:51:00.599
you get more efficiency out of the turbine
side, and the turbines are smaller and cheaper

1:51:00.599,1:51:01.400
to build.

1:51:01.400,1:51:02.400
The risk of accidents

1:51:02.400,1:51:07.110
We can achieve safety for less cost because
we're moving to passive safety rather than

1:51:07.110,1:51:11.709
engineered safety. We see this trend with
reactors like AP1000 but the LFTR can take

1:51:11.709,1:51:13.780
it to a much higher level.

1:51:13.780,1:51:18.400
Commercial nuclear energy around the world
has a very good safety record even if you

1:51:18.400,1:51:23.219
include Chernobyl. The number of deaths from
nuclear power plant accidents is less than

1:51:23.219,1:51:25.780
a hundred around the world, ever.

1:51:25.780,1:51:30.739
Just last year we had a natural gas explosion
at a clean energy facility in Middletown,

1:51:30.739,1:51:35.110
CT that killed seven people, a coal dust and
methane explosion at the Upper Big Branch

1:51:35.110,1:51:40.239
coal mine which killed 29 people, and a methane
explosion in Deepwater Horizon that killed

1:51:40.239,1:51:45.679
11 people. San Bruno fire, which was a natural
gas pipeline running underneath a neighborhood

1:51:45.679,1:51:49.320
and it blew up and killed about eight people
and destroyed 50 homes.

1:51:49.320,1:51:53.900
Why do you pick nuclear power to pick on?
Why don't you pick on gas transmission? Why

1:51:53.900,1:51:57.469
don't you pick on all these other sources
of actual deaths?

1:51:57.469,1:52:01.320
Long lived nuclear waste that has to be kept
out of the biosphere for over a quarter of

1:52:01.320,1:52:01.959
a million years.

1:52:01.959,1:52:06.199
Really most of that waste is unburned fuel.
There are ways to reprocess it and burn more,

1:52:06.199,1:52:10.860
but it's quite expensive and it's not economically
advantageous in today's reactors. The breakthrough

1:52:10.860,1:52:16.939
in going to fluid fuels means you don't have
to reprocess or recycle, you leave the nuclear

1:52:16.939,1:52:18.630
fuel in the reactor until it's burned up.

1:52:18.630,1:52:22.670
They remain in the salt and they decay in
the salt until they give off all their decay

1:52:22.670,1:52:23.499
heat.

1:52:23.499,1:52:30.499
Here's our transuranics - these figures show
10^-7, 10^-4, 10^-7, 10^-9 grams, this is

1:52:33.479,1:52:38.900
teeny teeny production. A thousandths of a
gram of these dreaded materials in 10 years

1:52:38.900,1:52:43.989
of operation. This is good. Waste profile,
much healthier.

1:52:43.989,1:52:45.639
The risk of nuclear proliferation

1:52:45.639,1:52:51.849
The proliferation hardening on this one, U-232,
we've got protactinium. It sends out a bright

1:52:51.849,1:52:57.869
gamma cascade, so if somebody tries to run
off with it we can catch them pretty easily.

1:52:57.869,1:53:01.630
You don't even have to look at those issues
for nuclear to fail.

1:53:01.630,1:53:06.719
The petrochemical industry, the hydrocarbon
industry spends a lot of money advertising.

1:53:06.719,1:53:13.070
They believe in wind and the sun. Exxon is
talking about growing algae, all kinds of

1:53:13.070,1:53:18.150
alternatives. You'll never hear a hydrocarbon
company talking about nuclear.

1:53:18.150,1:53:25.150
You'll see an awful lot of stories of somebody
in the gas or oil industry working against

1:53:25.179,1:53:30.900
nuclear and trying to raise the barriers of
entry. That's a simulated nuclear fuel pellet.

1:53:30.900,1:53:37.900
It's as much energy as a ton of coal, 147
gallons of oil, or 17,000 cubic feet of natural

1:53:38.219,1:53:39.389
gas.

1:53:39.389,1:53:44.479
If you're making money selling hydrocarbons,
you're going to make less money.

1:53:44.479,1:53:50.340
I was born the year they canceled this research
in Tennessee. I feel like all I've done with

1:53:50.340,1:53:55.469
the blog, is I've stood up and said, "Here's
this amazing work that was done before I was

1:53:55.469,1:53:56.380
even born."

1:53:56.380,1:54:01.079
This is laws of physics stuff. I didn't invent
it, all I do promote it. Maybe I'll never

1:54:01.079,1:54:04.570
see it happen in my life, but somebody will
do it. Once people have learned how to do

1:54:04.570,1:54:07.499
it, they'll keep using it, because it will
make that much of difference.

1:54:07.499,1:54:10.610
Other people who are a whole lot smarter than
me have looked at it and said, "This looks

1:54:10.610,1:54:12.630
darn pretty good, why aren't we doing this?"

1:54:12.630,1:54:14.420
How long do you think it's going to take?

1:54:14.420,1:54:18.019
At the rate we're going now in the United
States it'll never happen. But, that's going

1:54:18.019,1:54:18.280
to change.

1:54:18.280,1:54:22.170
We're going to make it happen. I think in
10 years we will be building LFTRs in factory

1:54:22.170,1:54:23.139
assembly lines.

1:54:23.139,1:54:26.969
We can be competitive with China on making
patents on things that weren't thought of

1:54:26.969,1:54:32.719
in the 50's and 60's. But, if we wait, Americans,
Canadians, and Brazilians will be buying LFTR

1:54:32.719,1:54:35.559
and molten salt technology from China and
paying them the royalties.

1:54:35.559,1:54:40.039
We buy a lot of things from China already.
It's not as if we're not buying enough things

1:54:40.039,1:54:46.860
from China. We are definitely keeping them
busy. Let's go develop thorium. That's really

1:54:46.860,1:54:48.559
what I'd like to do.

1:54:48.559,1:54:53.389
If everyone in the world has a lifestyle like
you and I can enjoy in Canada and U.S. today,

1:54:53.389,1:54:59.519
we can have world peace and we can specialize
on what areas we're good at, and trade with

1:54:59.519,1:55:02.780
one another, and not fight over limited resources.

1:55:02.780,1:55:06.209
I think things will proceed different this
time than they did in the 50's and 60's. Back

1:55:06.209,1:55:11.780
in the 50's and 60's, you had government appropriations
to national labs, which lead to the development

1:55:11.780,1:55:14.689
of this technology. I don't think that's how
it's going to happen this time. I think it's

1:55:14.689,1:55:18.659
going to be a fusion of the enthusiasts and
private industry.

1:55:18.659,1:55:23.050
Enough people now, thanks to the Internet,
are learning about the potential of LFTR and

1:55:23.050,1:55:24.659
thorium, and they're asking hard questions.

1:55:24.659,1:55:28.920
Mr. President, you often say there are no
silver bullets to our energy problems. Why

1:55:28.920,1:55:33.499
is the federal government not accelerating
research into fluid fuel molten salt reactors

1:55:33.499,1:55:35.030
that run on thorium?

1:55:35.030,1:55:38.729
Liquid fluoride thorium reactors, this is
the kind...

1:55:38.729,1:55:42.550
You're already above my pay grade so...

1:55:42.550,1:55:45.679
I'll explain it to you because this is the
kind of idea Washington needs to know about.

1:55:45.679,1:55:51.280
Pretty soon in 10 years we're going to buying
these things from them if we don't start making

1:55:51.280,1:55:54.729
them right now.

1:55:54.729,1:56:01.059
The AEC report given to John F. Kennedy at
his request in 1962, addresses directly the

1:56:01.059,1:56:07.459
fears that they had, and it specifically outlines
what we should have done. We have not done

1:56:07.459,1:56:11.769
it. We can do the thorium breeder reactor
which Weinberg and the Ornell team worked

1:56:11.769,1:56:18.070
on for 20 years and perfected and operated
for four years in the 1960's.

1:56:18.070,1:56:25.070
That reactor is exactly what China now has
a billion dollars to develop using our plans,

1:56:25.219,1:56:31.999
all our research, everything that we did as
an American research institution 49 years

1:56:31.999,1:56:38.329
ago. Even if Washington does operate slowly,
49 years does sound to be a little excessive.

1:56:38.329,1:56:41.959
If we don't do it, it will still be happening.
It will just be happening in a place like

1:56:41.959,1:56:46.090
China rather than the United States. We will
be seeing LFTRs being built in the future,

1:56:46.090,1:56:46.519
make no mistake.

1:56:46.519,1:56:50.729
A lot of environmentalists who are always
trying to drive us towards using less energy,

1:56:50.729,1:56:53.979
because all that energy's coming from the
consumption of fossil fuel.

1:56:53.979,1:56:58.260
Well, let's say your energy's not coming from
the consumption of fossil fuel. Then you could

1:56:58.260,1:57:03.309
use more energy, and you could use more energy
to accomplish things that you are not able

1:57:03.309,1:57:08.860
to do right now. Break up carbon dioxide and
dissociate water. Make fertilizer, grow crops,

1:57:08.860,1:57:09.619
all that.

1:57:09.619,1:57:14.889
So much energy, an abundance of energy, that
it would drive the price down to the point

1:57:14.889,1:57:19.619
where the only oil we'd be taking out of the
ground would be the easy to get to oil. And

1:57:19.619,1:57:24.079
there's not going to be any more environmental
devastation than there already is.

1:57:24.079,1:57:28.709
If we didn't have to worry about energy, we
could think of so many more things to do.

1:57:28.709,1:57:33.050
If there was a lot of it and it was cheap
and it was not harmful to the environment,

1:57:33.050,1:57:34.889
what would you do that you're not doing now?

1:57:34.889,1:57:39.139
The thing that caught my eye when I was still
in high school was the idea of a space solar

1:57:39.139,1:57:44.510
power satellite. Gerard O'Neill The High Frontier.
His idea was we were going to go build these

1:57:44.510,1:57:47.449
colonies. It was going to be like living in
a shopping mall in space.

1:57:47.449,1:57:53.559
You know and, have a little home in the tube.

1:57:53.559,1:57:56.840
I don't think we're ready to live in space
yet. We have not learned how to live in a

1:57:56.840,1:58:02.510
way where we recycle much more of our... I
mean, if you want to live in space, you've

1:58:02.510,1:58:03.689
got to recycle everything.

1:58:03.689,1:58:07.150
It seemed like the liquid fluoride thorium
reactor, or LFTR, could be the power source

1:58:07.150,1:58:11.900
that could make a self-sustainable lunar colony
a reality. But I have a simple question. If

1:58:11.900,1:58:17.170
it was such a great thing for a community
on the moon, why not a community on the earth,

1:58:17.170,1:58:18.150
self-sustaining and energy independent?

1:58:18.150,1:58:23.849
Think about "Star Trek." You can't help but
think about "Star Trek" when your name's Kirk.

1:58:23.849,1:58:28.360
What is the world of "Star Trek" running on?
Are they running "Star Trek" on coal? Are

1:58:28.360,1:58:32.469
they running "Star Trek" on oil sands? No.
You don't see any oil refineries on

1:58:32.469,1:58:34.269
"Star Trek". You don't see any coal mines.

1:58:34.269,1:58:40.439
We live much better lives today because we
have learned how to use carbon. OK, what about

1:58:40.439,1:58:47.389
thorium? Thorium has a million times the energy
density of a carbon-hydrogen bond. What could

1:58:47.389,1:58:52.809
that mean for human civilization going out
thousands, tens of thousands of years into

1:58:52.809,1:58:55.650
the future? Because, we're not going to run
out of this stuff. Once we've learned how

1:58:55.650,1:59:02.650
to use it at this kind of efficiency, we will
never run out.
