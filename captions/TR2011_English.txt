0:00:00.340,0:00:05.060
The heavy water reactor will use about 0.7
percent of the uranium's energy value, and

0:00:05.060,0:00:08.630
the light water reactor will use about half
of one percent. They both do terrible.

0:00:08.630,0:00:13.380
At normal pressures, water will boil at 100
degrees Celsius. This isn't nearly hot enough

0:00:13.380,0:00:18.280
to generate electricity effectively. So water
cooled reactors have to run at over 70 atmospheres

0:00:18.280,0:00:22.310
of pressure. You have to build a water cooled
reactor as a pressure vessel. The number one

0:00:22.310,0:00:24.529
accident people worry about...

0:00:24.529,0:00:28.760
Pressure is lost, water that's being held
at 300 degrees Celsius [makes splashing sound]

0:00:28.760,0:00:34.320
splashes to steam. Its volume increases roughly
by a factor of 1000. If you don't get emergency

0:00:34.320,0:00:38.010
coolant to the fuel in the reactor, it can
overheat and melt.

0:00:38.010,0:00:43.829
This is what drives the design of this building.
If this happens, all the steam is captured

0:00:43.829,0:00:44.739
in this building.

0:00:44.739,0:00:50.129
The reactors we have today use uranium oxide
as a fuel. It's a ceramic material, chemically

0:00:50.129,0:00:54.079
stable, but not very good at transferring
heat. If you lose pressure, you lose your

0:00:54.079,0:00:57.610
water, and soon your fuel will melt down and
release the radioactive fission products within

0:00:57.610,0:00:58.129
it.

0:00:58.129,0:01:03.629
So they have a series of emergency systems
designed to always keep the core covered with

0:01:03.629,0:01:08.649
water. We saw the failure of this at Fukushima
Daiichi. They had multiple backup diesel generators,

0:01:08.649,0:01:13.609
and each one probably had a very high probability
of turning on. The tsunami came and knocked

0:01:13.609,0:01:14.369
them all out.

0:01:14.369,0:01:16.929
People always say "Is nuclear energy safe?",
and the first thing I say is "Which one?"

0:01:16.929,0:01:20.990
There are thousands of different ways to do
nuclear energy. Is a car safe? Well, which

0:01:20.990,0:01:21.240
one?

0:01:21.240,0:01:24.810
I had the good fortune to learn about a different
form of nuclear power.

0:01:24.810,0:01:26.549
The liquid fluoride thorium reactor.

0:01:26.549,0:01:30.749
We can fully burn up the thorium in this reactor
versus only burning up part of the uranium

0:01:30.749,0:01:32.719
in a typical light water reactor.

0:01:32.719,0:01:37.349
It's not based on water cooling and it doesn't
use solid fuel. It's based on fluoride salts

0:01:37.349,0:01:42.380
as a nuclear fuel. You have to heat them up
to about 400 degrees Celsius to get them to

0:01:42.380,0:01:46.459
melt, but that's actually perfect for trying
to generate power in a nuclear reactor. Here's

0:01:46.459,0:01:50.700
the real magic - they don't have to operate
at high pressure. They don't have to use water

0:01:50.700,0:01:54.989
for coolant and there's nothing in the reactor
that's going to make a big change in density.

0:01:54.989,0:01:59.149
Unlike the solid fuels that can melt down
if you stop cooling them, these liquid fluoride

0:01:59.149,0:02:00.599
fuels are already melted.

0:02:00.599,0:02:04.389
In normal operation, you have a little piece
of frozen salt that you've kept frozen by

0:02:04.389,0:02:08.989
blowing cool gas over the outside of the pipe.
If there's an emergency and you lose all of

0:02:08.989,0:02:13.400
the power to your nuclear power plant, the
little blower stops blowing, the frozen plug

0:02:13.400,0:02:18.269
of salt melts, and the liquid fluoride fuel
inside the reactor drains out of the vessel

0:02:18.269,0:02:20.769
through the line and into another tank called
a drain tank.

0:02:20.769,0:02:25.209
In water cooled reactors, you generally have
to provide power to the plant to keep the

0:02:25.209,0:02:29.620
water circulating and to prevent a meltdown.
But if you lose power to the LFTR, it shuts

0:02:29.620,0:02:32.420
itself down all by itself without human intervention.

0:02:32.420,0:02:37.519
A staggeringly impressive level of safety,
even if there is physical damage to the reactor.

0:02:37.519,0:02:41.430
Thorium is a naturally occurring nuclear fuel
that is four times more common in the earth's

0:02:41.430,0:02:46.040
crust than uranium. It's so energy dense that
you can hold a lifetime supply of thorium

0:02:46.040,0:02:50.299
energy in the palm of your hand. We could
use thorium about 200 times more efficiently

0:02:50.299,0:02:54.879
than we're using uranium now. Because the
LFTR is capable of almost completely releasing

0:02:54.879,0:03:00.140
the energy in thorium, this reduces the waste
generated over uranium by factors of hundreds,

0:03:00.140,0:03:02.469
and by factors of millions over fossil fuels.

0:03:02.469,0:03:06.519
We're still going to need liquid fuels for
vehicles and machinery, but we can generate

0:03:06.519,0:03:10.239
these liquid fuels from the carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere and from water, much like

0:03:10.239,0:03:14.719
nature does. We could generate hydrogen by
splitting water and combining it with carbon

0:03:14.719,0:03:20.219
harvested from CO2 in the atmosphere, making
fuels like methanol, ammonia, and dimethyl

0:03:20.219,0:03:23.629
ether, which could be a direct replacement
for diesel fuels.

0:03:23.629,0:03:28.769
Imagine carbon neutral gasoline and diesel,
sustainable and self-produced.

0:03:28.769,0:03:34.719
You can see that uranium-235 is on par with
silver and platinum. Can you imagine burning

0:03:34.719,0:03:39.209
platinum for energy? And that's what we're
doing with our nuclear energy sources today,

0:03:39.209,0:03:44.670
we're burning this extremely rare stuff, and
we're not burning thorium.

0:03:44.670,0:03:49.290
Some people are kind of environmentalists,
and they say "Listen, nuclear power is not

0:03:49.290,0:03:53.409
sustainable. We're going to run out of uranium."
OK, I will yield that point to you, if we're

0:03:53.409,0:04:00.180
talking about today's nuclear technology.
In 2007 we used 5 billion tons of coal, 31

0:04:00.180,0:04:05.529
billion barrels of oil, and 5 trillion cubic
meters of natural gas, along with 65,000 tons

0:04:05.529,0:04:07.670
of uranium to produce the world's energy.

0:04:07.670,0:04:11.900
I have a friend who's trying to start a rare
earth mine in Missouri. "Jim, how much thorium

0:04:11.900,0:04:16.709
do you think you'll be pawing up a year?"
And he goes, "I think about 5,000 tons." 5,000

0:04:16.709,0:04:22.860
tons of thorium would supply the planet with
all of its energy for a year. And he goes

0:04:22.860,0:04:26.630
"And there's like a zillion other places on
earth that are just like my mine. It's a nice

0:04:26.630,0:04:30.300
mine, but it's not unique, it's not like this
is the one place on earth where this is found."

0:04:30.300,0:04:35.960
Every time mankind has been able to access
a new source of energy, it has led to profound

0:04:35.960,0:04:41.669
societal implications. Human beings had slaves
for thousands and thousands of years. When

0:04:41.669,0:04:45.830
we learned how to make carbon our slave, instead
of other human beings, we started to learn

0:04:45.830,0:04:48.330
how to be able to be civilized people.

0:04:48.330,0:04:54.750
Thorium has a million times the energy density
of a carbon-hydrogen bond. What could that

0:04:54.750,0:04:59.270
mean for human civilization? Because we're
not going to run out of this stuff. We will

0:04:59.270,0:05:06.270
never run out. It is simply too common.

0:05:12.910,0:05:19.910
On our Facebook page, the gender demographic
is about 87 percent male, 13 percent female.

0:06:10.259,0:06:15.300
I have never been a proponent for nuclear
energy. It's because of the consumption, right?

0:06:15.300,0:06:20.610
It allows us to continuously consume that
I believe is unsustainable.

0:06:20.610,0:06:23.889
Do you think other forms of energy will prevent
us from consuming as much?

0:06:23.889,0:06:29.550
If we're running out of it, yes. I think we
will start to ration it and re-use things

0:06:29.550,0:06:31.129
as opposed to just creating a new one.

0:06:31.129,0:06:34.750
What about solar and wind then? The sun will
always shine, the wind will always blow.

0:06:34.750,0:06:36.110
Those give us life support.

0:06:36.110,0:06:38.580
Thin gruel of a diet of energy.

0:06:38.580,0:06:42.240
Yeah. I believe we don't really appreciate
what we have, and I only speak for myself.

0:06:42.240,0:06:47.690
So you intuitively perceive wind and solar
as being energy sources that are not on the

0:06:47.690,0:06:49.729
same par with like oil and gas.

0:06:49.729,0:06:54.050
In the scope that we're currently using them,
and I think that if we amplify the scope of

0:06:54.050,0:06:58.740
both wind and solar, then we're also going
to be looking at a larger destruction as well.

0:06:58.740,0:07:04.229
So you recognize that wind and solar are environmentally
invasive forms of energy generation? They

0:07:04.229,0:07:05.590
take up a lot of area.

0:07:05.590,0:07:06.220
Yeah.

0:07:06.220,0:07:11.479
In order to prevent unacceptable levels of
environmental destruction limit how much wind

0:07:11.479,0:07:12.330
and solar we put in.

0:07:12.330,0:07:16.629
We'll have to use them in different ways incorporating
them within already existing structures.

0:07:16.629,0:07:20.009
I actually looked at this with my own home.
If I covered the house with solar panels how

0:07:20.009,0:07:23.650
much would I make and the problem was it wasn't
nearly enough. Their performance went down.

0:07:23.650,0:07:26.789
Every single time I go on the roof to clean
the solar panels I'll be putting my life at

0:07:26.789,0:07:27.039
risk.

0:07:26.990,0:07:29.210
We have roofers, we have people that do that
professionally.

0:07:29.210,0:07:33.720
My brother's a roofer. It's a rough job. That's
why a 21-year-old like him was out roofing

0:07:33.720,0:07:37.159
roofs and making big money because he was
putting his life at risk, just like the coal

0:07:37.159,0:07:37.580
miners.

0:07:37.580,0:07:42.699
You perceive it as a good thing to constrain
energy supply right?

0:07:42.699,0:07:43.979
Yeah. I do.

0:07:43.979,0:07:50.020
Going to a low energy lifestyle will almost
certainly correlate to going to a lower-quality-of-life

0:07:50.020,0:07:50.780
lifestyle.

0:07:50.780,0:07:54.500
While efficiency is worthy of being pursued
and we could probably all knock 25 percent

0:07:54.500,0:07:58.789
of our energy consumption out, that's not
nearly enough to eliminate the need for fossil

0:07:58.789,0:07:59.270
fuels.

0:07:59.270,0:08:02.849
Elizabeth May, you know, she may be saying,
and I would probably agree with her, "We should

0:08:02.849,0:08:05.780
pursue more energy efficient lifestyles,"
absolutely.

0:08:05.780,0:08:10.060
When you came to debate oil sands/tar sands
development in Calgary, you set up sort of

0:08:10.060,0:08:14.550
an expectation on what would be acceptable.
You said certain return on energy efficiency.

0:08:14.550,0:08:19.169
Some nuclear technologies that I think are
quite promising, liquid fluoride thorium reactor.

0:08:19.169,0:08:21.729
Our policy is very simple to understand, no
nuclear.

0:08:21.729,0:08:25.490
Is there more nuance demanded there? Concerns
about nuclear energy can be addressed with

0:08:25.490,0:08:26.979
future technologies?

0:08:26.979,0:08:31.490
Since the Greens have a policy against nuclear
energy, would we ever reconsider with some

0:08:31.490,0:08:35.360
of the new technologies which are being discussed
but don't yet exist? I guess the answer is,

0:08:35.360,0:08:35.890
of course.

0:08:35.890,0:08:40.100
If Greens globally found some reason to re-assess
nuclear, but we only have a limited amount

0:08:40.100,0:08:44.210
of money. You want to reduce green house gases.
So you want to apply the dollars in ways that

0:08:44.210,0:08:47.690
reduce the green house gases the most while
creating the most employment possible for

0:08:47.690,0:08:48.480
that investment.

0:08:48.480,0:08:53.310
We waste 60 percent of all the energy that's
used in Canada. And that's because of inefficient

0:08:53.310,0:08:58.390
building and transportation design. Our infrastructure
is designed for cheap and abundant energy.

0:08:58.390,0:09:03.000
So, no surprise, there's lots and lots of
waste. What you want to do is improve productivity

0:09:03.000,0:09:04.140
with which we use energy.

0:09:04.140,0:09:07.820
When you look through the whole hierarchy
of choices and options that we have and we

0:09:07.820,0:09:13.760
have a long list of options that work quite
well, nuclear energy is down the list because

0:09:13.760,0:09:19.440
it's not terribly reliable, it's hugely expensive
capital cost, very few jobs created and it

0:09:19.440,0:09:24.850
only produces electricity. It's about 14 years
from when you project forward to when it's

0:09:24.850,0:09:29.510
built and it's famous for cost overruns. The
risk of accidents, long lived nuclear waste

0:09:29.510,0:09:32.760
that has to be kept out of the biosphere for
a quarter of a million years. The risk of

0:09:32.760,0:09:36.760
nuclear proliferation for use in military
terms, you don't even have to look at those

0:09:36.760,0:09:41.100
issues for nuclear to fail.

0:09:41.100,0:09:45.740
We should pursue more energy efficient lifestyles,
absolutely. How far can we go, though? Will

0:09:45.740,0:09:50.890
it be enough to make it so that we don't need
to have better and newer forms of energy generation?

0:09:50.890,0:09:52.730
I don't think so. I don't think even close.

0:09:52.730,0:09:54.760
You don't see wind and solar as...

0:09:54.760,0:09:59.170
We have been trying to put solar and wind
online for decades. It is still on the order

0:09:59.170,0:10:04.260
of about one percent of total energy production
in the United States. Wind is quoted in terms

0:10:04.260,0:10:10.320
of its capacity. Like you'll say this is a
three megawatt windmill. If I have a 3,000

0:10:10.320,0:10:14.720
megawatt nuclear plant, 1000 of these windmills
are equivalent to one of these. The wind is

0:10:14.720,0:10:18.060
only blowing about 15 percent of the time,
one out of six.

0:10:18.060,0:10:21.760
That correlation becomes absolutely meaningless
now, because one is running all the time and

0:10:21.760,0:10:25.670
the other one is only running one out of six
times. If you had a car and you thought "I'm

0:10:25.670,0:10:29.470
going to go out and get in my car and turn
the ignition, and I have a one in six chance

0:10:29.470,0:10:33.910
the car's going to turn on." How useful would
that car be to you? The wind industry says,

0:10:33.910,0:10:37.940
"That's OK, Chelsea, you need to have six
cars." Energy is all about reliability.

0:10:37.940,0:10:44.540
Can we address those concerns by using batteries
which are making great advances with nothing

0:10:44.540,0:10:45.470
more than a laptop?

0:10:45.470,0:10:49.690
It's a very, very expensive proposition to
use battery backup for the grid. It has not

0:10:49.690,0:10:53.770
ever been able to be accomplished on a grid
level before because of how much it costs

0:10:53.770,0:10:55.280
to store a watt hour in a battery.

0:10:55.280,0:10:58.170
You're not even looking at lithium-ion, you're
looking at cheap batteries. You know, you're

0:10:58.170,0:11:01.930
looking at like lead-acid, really cheap batteries.
Because you need a lot of them. It's better

0:11:01.930,0:11:04.730
to get a bunch of lousy ones than to get a
few really good ones.

0:11:04.730,0:11:09.050
If we had a high-conducting or... what do
you call them?

0:11:09.050,0:11:09.480
Superconducting?

0:11:09.480,0:11:10.870
Intermittent power from multiple sources.

0:11:10.870,0:11:14.210
If you want to make a power transmission line,
you want to make the economic case pay off

0:11:14.210,0:11:17.040
for you. You have to show how electricity
is going to be thrown into that line almost

0:11:17.040,0:11:21.140
all the time. Otherwise, it's not worth building,
it costs too much money.

0:11:21.140,0:11:24.000
So the idea that "OK, there's going to be
a wind farm here, there's going to be a solar

0:11:24.000,0:11:27.440
array here, and there's going to be a wind
farm over here, and one of these three at

0:11:27.440,0:11:31.500
any time will be working, but we'll have power
transmission lines to all of them." I mean

0:11:31.500,0:11:34.750
that's just nonsensical. People who propose
that haven't run the numbers.

0:11:34.750,0:11:37.580
People don't want to see power plants and
power transmission lines. They will fight

0:11:37.580,0:11:42.300
tooth and nail against power transmission
lines. We need to have a reliable energy source

0:11:42.300,0:11:45.260
that is close to where the energy is needed
to be consumed.

0:11:45.260,0:11:47.310
I know how you can get more women on board.

0:11:47.310,0:11:47.780
OK.

0:11:47.780,0:11:48.760
Go on Oprah.

0:11:48.760,0:11:52.720
Oh! How could I get in her book club?

0:11:52.720,0:11:57.850
Many of you have been part of a class in nuclear
science and the politics surrounding that.

0:11:57.850,0:11:59.530
Thank you so much for joining me today.

0:11:59.530,0:12:01.380
Thank you very much, Kiki, I'm glad to be
here.

0:12:01.380,0:12:03.010
Hey, you guys are a pretty techy group, right?

0:12:03.010,0:12:06.240
There was a sign that was talking about what
hacking was about. There's such a thing as

0:12:06.240,0:12:07.190
nuclear hacking.

0:12:07.190,0:12:12.600
I'm very glad to be here with you today and
be a part of this discussion.

0:12:12.600,0:12:16.280
The answer is energy cheaper than from coal.

0:12:16.280,0:12:21.030
All sorts of things that give us the advantage
and they're all based on energy.

0:12:21.030,0:12:26.380
Based upon the assumption that we're willing
to only sacrifice 160 million people's lives

0:12:26.380,0:12:31.890
to sea rise, climate change, and so forth,
then January 2011, we need to start reducing

0:12:31.890,0:12:34.520
CO2 emissions by four percent a year...

0:12:34.520,0:12:40.630
Well, are we doing that?

0:12:40.630,0:12:47.630
I was two years and ten months old when I
saw Star Wars. It is my earliest memory. My

0:12:51.820,0:12:56.520
dad didn't believe that I actually remembered
that until I started actually relating details

0:12:56.520,0:12:59.700
from the day it happened. He said after that
all I could talk about was space.

0:12:59.700,0:13:04.770
I spent 10 years working at NASA. In the beginning
of my time there in 2000, this is the kind

0:13:04.770,0:13:09.350
of community I was thinking of. It had all
of the same needs as a community on earth

0:13:09.350,0:13:15.480
would have, but it had some very unique constraints.
There's no coal on the moon, there's no petroleum,

0:13:15.480,0:13:20.630
there's no natural gas, there's no wind, there's
no atmosphere. The moon orbits the earth once

0:13:20.630,0:13:25.030
a month. For two weeks, the sun goes down
and your solar panels don't make any energy.

0:13:25.030,0:13:28.530
If you want to try to store enough energy
in batteries for two weeks, it just simply

0:13:28.530,0:13:29.060
isn't practical.

0:13:29.060,0:13:34.400
I thought nuclear power was dumb. I had no
interest in it. I was like "Ah, old junk,

0:13:34.400,0:13:37.120
who would want to be into that?" It wasn't
until I realized that these efficiencies were

0:13:37.120,0:13:39.910
possible that I began getting really interested.

0:13:39.910,0:13:43.590
I'm in this buddy of mine's office. He's got
this book on his shelf and the book was called

0:13:43.590,0:13:47.090
"Fluid Fuel Reactors". He used to work at
Oak Ridge National Labs in Tennessee and he

0:13:47.090,0:13:51.900
said "Yeah, way back when, they were doing
some stuff on this at Oak Ridge," he goes

0:13:51.900,0:13:57.440
"I just went to the library and I got this
old book." It was written in 1958 and he said

0:13:57.440,0:14:01.350
"I've been meaning to look through it. I knew
a little bit about it but not very much."

0:14:01.350,0:14:06.080
So I took the book home, a big old thick book,
it was about 1,000 pages, struggling really

0:14:06.080,0:14:10.080
hard to try to grasp the nuclear concepts
in the book but it was intriguing enough to

0:14:10.080,0:14:15.150
me and it seemed really different than the
kind of nuclear energy that we have now. They

0:14:15.150,0:14:18.860
also mention in this book a lot about thorium.
Thorium, thorium, thorium, thorium. I was

0:14:18.860,0:14:20.680
like "Dude, what the heck is thorium?"

0:14:20.680,0:14:24.820
But I was intrigued enough that I began researching
as much as I could. I was reading online,

0:14:24.820,0:14:27.450
I was reading blogs especially Rod Adams.

0:14:27.450,0:14:31.460
Taxpayers in the United States sent me to
sea on submarines. I've lived in an environment

0:14:31.460,0:14:36.810
that was 100 percent nuclear powered. It's
something that people just don't hear about.

0:14:36.810,0:14:42.240
Nobody in the world knew that a self-sustained
fission chain reaction was even possible up

0:14:42.240,0:14:48.170
until somewhere around 1938. Very few people
understand all these options that are available

0:14:48.170,0:14:49.330
in nuclear energy.

0:14:49.330,0:14:54.820
Now with liquid fluoride thorium reactors,
no high-level waste material is generated

0:14:54.820,0:14:59.910
and it can also reduced stockpiles of existing
waste. So given that, is there more the government

0:14:59.910,0:15:01.880
can do to test the technology?

0:15:01.880,0:15:06.780
The reality is that we have waste, so it's
not going to improve the nuclear waste.

0:15:06.780,0:15:11.800
Please forgive my ignorance, but what is thorium?

0:15:11.800,0:15:17.190
If only my O-level science teacher could see
me now. It is named after the Norse god Thor

0:15:17.190,0:15:22.230
and I know the noble baroness will be pleased
to know that it's dimorphic and there are

0:15:22.230,0:15:29.230
all sorts of other facts that she can find
in Wikipedia, as indeed, I did.

0:15:30.050,0:15:33.700
My lords, my lords... my lords.

0:15:33.700,0:15:40.540
The Department of Energy cited my website
as the single technical source for the molten

0:15:40.540,0:15:45.350
salt reactor in their Generation IV when they
first published it. People say "Well that's

0:15:45.350,0:15:51.240
quite an honor," no it's actually very pathetic
because I'm Joe sitting in my garage doing

0:15:51.240,0:15:55.420
a website and this is the single technical
source you came up with?

0:15:55.420,0:15:59.890
Does the administration understand all the
options available? No. Does anybody really

0:15:59.890,0:16:06.890
understand clearly the fact that nuclear energy
is a completely disruptive technology?

0:16:07.810,0:16:11.920
The liquid fluoride thorium reactor, I saw
some of you kind of smile when it brings up

0:16:11.920,0:16:15.750
and that does concern me a little bit. What
are you hearing about LFTR that's not... what

0:16:15.750,0:16:18.330
are you hearing about the molten salt reactors
that's not there?

0:16:18.330,0:16:23.640
I would really be surprised if our leadership
knows about this. I don't think they read

0:16:23.640,0:16:27.880
blogs. The fact that we have an Internet today
is going to ultimately make the difference.

0:16:27.880,0:16:32.310
You know we had Bronze Age and we had Iron
Age and we had the Industrial Revolution.

0:16:32.310,0:16:36.010
I really think hundreds of years from now,
they'll say there was a Thorium Age that began.

0:16:36.010,0:16:39.550
Let me tell you how this stuff was discovered.
There was a guy named Glenn Seaborg who worked

0:16:39.550,0:16:46.000
at Berkeley Labs in California in 1942. This
was the guy who discovered plutonium. Coming

0:16:46.000,0:16:52.200
off discovering plutonium he thought, "I wonder
if we can hit thorium with a neutron and turn

0:16:52.200,0:16:54.560
it into something." You got to remember, fission
had been discovered three years earlier, so

0:16:54.560,0:16:55.950
they were still in the very beginnings.

0:16:55.950,0:16:58.720
So he got this grad student. You know, everybody
who's been a grad student knows what it's

0:16:58.720,0:17:02.190
like when a professor says, "All right. I
want you to go into the nuclear lab and turn

0:17:02.190,0:17:07.740
on the neutron bombardment system and expose
this sample of radioactive material and find

0:17:07.740,0:17:09.449
out what happens."

0:17:09.449,0:17:13.079
"It's a war right now, isn't it, sir, right?
I could be on the front lines."

0:17:13.079,0:17:13.589
"Yes, you could."

0:17:13.589,0:17:15.529
"OK. Yes sir. Absolutely. Off I go."

0:17:15.529,0:17:20.110
So the grad student went off, and he did the
experiment. And he came back to Seaborg, and

0:17:20.110,0:17:25.019
he said, "Yep, I've done it, sir. I have made
something new. Thorium did absorb the neutron.

0:17:25.019,0:17:28.279
It became uranium-233. Isn't that cool?"

0:17:28.279,0:17:32.860
Seaborg said, "Yes, absolutely. OK! Now, let's
take the next step, poor little grad student!

0:17:32.860,0:17:37.830
I want you to go back. Now I want you to hit
it with a neutron and see if it will fission.

0:17:37.830,0:17:40.309
Because I think it'll fission. I think it'll
fission just like uranium-235."

0:17:40.309,0:17:41.840
"OK. Yes sir."

0:17:41.840,0:17:46.409
Goes off, does the experiment, comes back
and says, "Yep, you were right. It did fission.

0:17:46.409,0:17:49.960
You're correct. It is a new form of nuclear
fuel."

0:17:49.960,0:17:55.090
Then Seaborg popped the really, really important
question. He said, "Now I want you to go figure

0:17:55.090,0:18:02.090
out how many neutrons came off when it fissioned.
Because if that number is below 2, we really

0:18:02.470,0:18:07.720
don't have a story here. If this number...
you come back, and say it's like 1.5, then...

0:18:07.720,0:18:13.899
interesting fact goes in the back of the book.
But if that number's above 2, then that is

0:18:13.899,0:18:14.580
a big deal."

0:18:14.580,0:18:19.850
Goes back, comes back. "Sir, the number is
2.5."

0:18:19.850,0:18:25.289
Seaborg looks at his grad student. This is
December 1942, and he said, "You've just made

0:18:25.289,0:18:28.279
a $50 quadrillion discovery."

0:18:28.279,0:18:32.860
Grad student was like "Uhh!"

0:18:32.860,0:18:39.860
Seaborg was absolutely right. He had figured
out that thorium could serve as an essentially

0:18:40.159,0:18:47.029
unlimited nuclear fuel. And he knew how abundant
thorium was in the crust of the Earth. And

0:18:47.029,0:18:53.100
he realized that through this process, if
you had some uranium-233, you could catalyze

0:18:53.100,0:18:56.549
the burning of thorium indefinitely.

0:18:56.549,0:19:01.690
You're fissioning uranium-233, but you're
making a new one. So it's not really a catalyst

0:19:01.690,0:19:06.580
in the true chemical sense that a catalyst
is not consumed in a reaction. But you can

0:19:06.580,0:19:08.950
almost think about it as a pseudo-catalyst.

0:19:08.950,0:19:12.830
So we'll take it from first principles. Let's
talk a bit about what nuclear fission is.

0:19:12.830,0:19:17.820
You have fissile nuclei. That means this is
a nucleus. If you hit it with a neutron, it's

0:19:17.820,0:19:23.250
going to fission and split into two pieces,
two fission products. And also significantly,

0:19:23.250,0:19:28.059
this one neutron is going to spawn the formation
of two or three additional neutrons.

0:19:28.059,0:19:33.740
Why do we care? Here's why we care...

0:19:33.740,0:19:40.529
Because every kilogram of fissile material
will produce as much energy as 13,000 barrels

0:19:40.529,0:19:47.490
of oil. Nuclear fission is a million times
more energy-dense than a chemical reaction.

0:19:47.490,0:19:52.320
Civilization has changed over advancements
in technology a whole lot more modest than

0:19:52.320,0:19:52.990
this.

0:19:52.990,0:19:57.320
When you fission something, it breaks into
these two pieces, but they're radioactive.

0:19:57.320,0:19:58.419
Why are they radioactive?

0:19:58.419,0:20:03.929
And this is a chart that shows the number
of protons in matter and the number of neutrons.

0:20:03.929,0:20:09.470
Now, if the number of protons and the number
of neutrons were the same, all of these isotopes

0:20:09.470,0:20:12.100
would stay on this nice line right here, you
see?

0:20:12.100,0:20:16.840
But they don't do that. At the beginning,
it's a roughly equal number of protons and

0:20:16.840,0:20:21.399
neutrons. But as they get heavier, they definitely
get on the very neutron-rich side of things.

0:20:21.399,0:20:26.429
You see these black dots? Those are the stable
nuclides and all the other guys are radioactive.

0:20:26.429,0:20:31.360
The strong nuclear forces holding the nucleus
together, the protons are pushing the nucleus

0:20:31.360,0:20:35.090
apart. OK, the protons are all positively
charged they want rip the thing apart. The

0:20:35.090,0:20:40.289
neutrons are adding more of that strong nuclear
force glue, holding everything together and

0:20:40.289,0:20:43.379
they are not adding more of the push-it-apart
stuff.

0:20:43.379,0:20:49.480
Way down here are uranium and thorium and
they have about one and half times as many

0:20:49.480,0:20:54.850
neutrons as protons. When you burst them in
half the two pieces that you get inherit that

0:20:54.850,0:21:00.110
ratio but it's the wrong ratio for them. They
are over here they wanted to be more like

0:21:00.110,0:21:02.059
one and a quarter instead of one and a half.

0:21:02.059,0:21:05.620
They have too many neutrons. Nature has a
nifty process for fixing this little problem

0:21:05.620,0:21:09.659
it's called beta decay. A neutron essentially
turns into a proton and it spits out an electron.

0:21:09.659,0:21:14.159
When you fission a nucleus why is what you
get out radioactive? And it has to do with

0:21:14.159,0:21:18.759
this proton and neutron balance. The balance
is wrong for what you have made even though

0:21:18.759,0:21:20.440
it was right for what you started with.

0:21:20.440,0:21:26.590
These are the mass numbers of each of those
and they assume two broad peaks of distribution.

0:21:26.590,0:21:30.990
This is the smaller fission product and this
is the larger fission product because each

0:21:30.990,0:21:35.620
fission generates two of them. But, because
they are neutron rich they have to beta decay

0:21:35.620,0:21:38.240
a couple of times before they reach a stable
nucleus.

0:21:38.240,0:21:42.879
Let's talk just a minute about radioactivity
because I had an erroneous notion of what

0:21:42.879,0:21:46.710
radioactivity was. I thought that if you had
something that have like a half-life of a

0:21:46.710,0:21:51.090
day, and you had something that had a half-life
of a million years, it meant that the dude

0:21:51.090,0:21:55.970
that was radioactive for a day is like brrrrrr
for a day and then, "Opp! I'm done." And the

0:21:55.970,0:21:59.700
dude with half-life for a million years is
like brrrrrrrrr for a million years and done.

0:21:59.700,0:22:00.419
OK.

0:22:00.419,0:22:04.649
So you go which one of these is more dangerous?
Well, definitely the one that's got a half-life

0:22:04.649,0:22:08.649
of a million years because that's got to be
like radioactive forever and the dude's radioactive

0:22:08.649,0:22:11.509
for a day that's not a big deal, right?

0:22:11.509,0:22:17.340
Completely wrong. OK. Utterly backwards. The
dude who is radioactive for a day is really,

0:22:17.340,0:22:23.370
really radioactive. The dude that’s radioactive
for a million years is hardly radioactive

0:22:23.370,0:22:27.649
at all. Which one of those two is more dangerous?
The one that's radioactive for a day by a

0:22:27.649,0:22:29.480
long shot.

0:22:29.480,0:22:35.870
So your radioactivity is directly and inversely
proportional to your half-life. So all these

0:22:35.870,0:22:40.289
guys that have real short half-lives, very,
very dangerous, but they are going away real

0:22:40.289,0:22:45.580
quick. This guy, 2.3 million years, no problem.
It's not going to hurt you. It's just not

0:22:45.580,0:22:47.240
nearly radioactive enough.

0:22:47.240,0:22:51.409
Now What about thorium and uranium? Both are
naturally occurring materials. Thorium has

0:22:51.409,0:22:57.909
only one isotope thorium-232. It has a 14
billion year half-life. So when the Universe

0:22:57.909,0:23:02.039
is twice as old as it is now, thorium will
have only decayed one half-life.

0:23:02.039,0:23:06.330
What does it tell you how radioactive thorium
is?

0:23:06.330,0:23:12.350
Hardly at all. That's why it is still around.
Uranium, two isotopes uranium-235, uranium-238

0:23:12.350,0:23:16.379
both of course are radioactive. U-238 has
a 5 billion year half-life, that's pretty

0:23:16.379,0:23:19.899
old, that's how old the earth is, that's how
old the Universe is.

0:23:19.899,0:23:24.019
Uranium-235 on the other hand has a much shorter
half-life, seven hundred million years. OK.

0:23:24.019,0:23:27.240
How common is this stuff on the earth? Most
of the earth is made of oxygen. Isn't that

0:23:27.240,0:23:32.499
strange? Like 46 percent of the crust of the
earth is oxygen. Because everything is oxidized,

0:23:32.499,0:23:35.879
all the rocks, then silicon, aluminum, iron,
calcium, a bunch of stuff.

0:23:35.879,0:23:40.759
Well here is thorium at 10 parts per million,
but there is other stuff that we think of

0:23:40.759,0:23:45.740
that is even less common; beryllium, tin,
tungsten. Here's uranium, two and a half parts

0:23:45.740,0:23:50.960
per million. Tungsten, aluminum, mercury,
silver, and no surprise where is gold? That's

0:23:50.960,0:23:52.710
why girls want you to give it to them.

0:23:52.710,0:23:58.070
Now, let's say we were looking at uranium-235
as if it was its own thing. It's less than

0:23:58.070,0:24:03.350
one percent of uranium, it's about 0.7 percent
uranium. You can see that uranium-235 is on

0:24:03.350,0:24:07.450
par with the abundance of silver and platinum.

0:24:07.450,0:24:12.889
Can you imagine burning platinum for energy?
That would just be nuts. It is nuts. And that's

0:24:12.889,0:24:18.039
literally what we're doing with our nuclear
energy sources today. We're burning this extremely

0:24:18.039,0:24:25.009
rare stuff and we're not burning the common
stuff, the uranium-238 and the thorium. We're

0:24:25.009,0:24:27.539
leaving that stuff unburnt.

0:24:27.539,0:24:32.570
Some people who are kind of environmentalists,
they say, "Listen, nuclear power is not sustainable."

0:24:32.570,0:24:36.940
They say to me, "We're going to run out of
uranium." I said, "OK. I will yield that point

0:24:36.940,0:24:41.950
to you if we're talking about today's nuclear
technology. On the other hand, if we start

0:24:41.950,0:24:45.840
thinking about some of these other things
we can do, that story changes."

0:24:45.840,0:24:51.559
Thorium all by itself is not going to release
nuclear energy. But if you hit the thorium

0:24:51.559,0:24:55.669
with a neutron, the thorium will absorb the
neutron and it will turn from thorium-232

0:24:55.669,0:25:02.249
into thorium-233. Thorium-233 only has a half-life
of like 20 minutes, so is it really radioactive?

0:25:02.249,0:25:08.730
Oh yeah, smoking radioactive, really, really
hot stuff. It's going to decay into protactinium-233,

0:25:08.730,0:25:10.559
which has a half-life of about a month.

0:25:10.559,0:25:14.379
So, pretty darn hot stuff. You probably don't
want to mess with this stuff either. Then

0:25:14.379,0:25:18.879
it will decay over about a month to uranium-233,
which has a half life of about 160,000 years,

0:25:18.879,0:25:22.200
and is much less radioactive.

0:25:22.200,0:25:27.409
Uranium-233, if you hit it with a neutron
it will fission. In addition to releasing

0:25:27.409,0:25:32.700
all that energy, it will release two or three
additional neutrons. You need one of those

0:25:32.700,0:25:37.559
neutrons to go find another thorium and you
need another one of those neutrons to find

0:25:37.559,0:25:41.169
another uranium-233 to continue the reaction.

0:25:41.169,0:25:47.759
Some of these fission products have a really
big propensity to eat neutrons. The way they

0:25:47.759,0:25:53.009
describe this in nuclear reactions is they
call it a cross section. How probable is a

0:25:53.009,0:25:58.759
reaction going to be? One of those fission
products is named xenon-135, and here is its

0:25:58.759,0:26:04.590
cross section relative to two nuclear fuels.
See these little bitty guys? Imagine we're

0:26:04.590,0:26:07.960
playing darts or something, and throwing them.
Which one are we going to hit?

0:26:07.960,0:26:14.090
When xenon-135 forms from fission, look at
all these chain, blah, blah, blah. Where's

0:26:14.090,0:26:21.090
135? OK, that's not particularly an uncommon
event to form that particular guy. Xenon-135

0:26:24.769,0:26:29.999
has a half life of nine hours. It's very radioactive,
but during that nine hours, it really wants

0:26:29.999,0:26:30.940
to eat your neutron.

0:26:30.940,0:26:31.190
This turns out to be a big problem for real
nuclear reactors. It messes up how they want

0:26:31.169,0:26:32.879
to operate because of the existence of xenon.
This actually was a contributing effect to

0:26:32.879,0:26:39.289
the Chernobyl disaster was the presence of
xenon-135. And it's really hard to deal with

0:26:39.289,0:26:45.580
in solid fuel reactors. Xenon was such a big
deal, in fact, this was one of the first reactors

0:26:45.580,0:26:50.499
that was ever built. This was the Hanford
reactor in Washington. They built this during

0:26:50.499,0:26:54.360
the Manhattan project to make plutonium for
nuclear weapons.

0:26:54.360,0:26:58.740
When they first built it, they turned it on
and everything seemed to be going. After about

0:26:58.740,0:27:05.340
a day or two of running it, all of a sudden
the power went and dropped, almost to zero.

0:27:05.340,0:27:09.480
They were like, "What the heck is that?",
and they couldn't figure it out. They left

0:27:09.480,0:27:15.970
it alone, and after about 12 or 18 hours it
went and it came back up to power again, and

0:27:15.970,0:27:21.100
it held there. They're like, "What?", and
pretty soon it goes and drops off again. They're

0:27:21.100,0:27:25.139
going, "This makes no sense, we're not doing
anything! The thing's turning on and turning

0:27:25.139,0:27:27.399
off, and it's turning on and it's turning
off."

0:27:27.399,0:27:33.929
What was going on was, the reactor would turn
on, and xenon-135 would begin to build up.

0:27:33.929,0:27:37.769
And as it built up, it would start eating
all these neurons, right. And they were and

0:27:37.769,0:27:41.110
it would take the reactor back down again.

0:27:41.110,0:27:44.869
Then after a while it would decay away, and
once it decayed away [makes ascending plane

0:27:44.869,0:27:50.330
sound] the reactor would come back on again.
So it was following this up and down effect.

0:27:50.330,0:27:53.320
Just crazy, I mean, these guys didn't even
know what xenon-135 was, because this was

0:27:53.320,0:27:58.720
one of the first nuclear reactors ever built.
Luckily for us, the guy who built this reactor

0:27:58.720,0:28:00.789
was this guy, Eugene Wigner.

0:28:00.789,0:28:02.399
He was unbelievably brilliant, maybe one of
the smartest guys who ever lived. Won the

0:28:02.399,0:28:05.110
Nobel Prize. He would just lie in bed, trying
to figure out “How far ahead of the Germans

0:28:05.110,0:28:08.529
are we? Where do you think they are?” He
was just always gaming it and trying to figure

0:28:08.529,0:28:08.830
it out.

0:28:08.830,0:28:13.139
He had thought, "What could possibly go wrong
in this machine I built." He goes, "Well,

0:28:13.139,0:28:18.639
there could be something that we'll make that
will be very, very absorptive of neutrons.

0:28:18.639,0:28:24.559
And that something we make might decay quickly.
And if it was really absorptive and it decayed

0:28:24.559,0:28:26.220
quickly, the reactor would do... this!"

0:28:26.220,0:28:32.249
He didn't know what it was yet! He just was
hypothesizing that such a thing existed! And

0:28:32.249,0:28:36.149
so when this machine of his started doing
this, he goes, "I think I know what's going

0:28:36.149,0:28:40.980
on." There were a bunch of places to put in
extra fuel, and he was able to override this

0:28:40.980,0:28:44.789
effect. I mean, we're really lucky he did
this, or we would not have been able to finish

0:28:44.789,0:28:48.980
the Manhattan Project. So they were able to
complete the creation of plutonium in order

0:28:48.980,0:28:50.820
to make the first nuclear weapon.

0:28:50.820,0:28:55.610
They took natural uranium, and they separated
those two isotopes, highly enriched it in

0:28:55.610,0:29:02.460
uranium-235. They'd take uranium-235 from
less than one percent up to like 90-plus percent.

0:29:02.460,0:29:07.989
And this was really hard. It took big factories,
very difficult to do isotopic enrichment.

0:29:07.989,0:29:12.720
But this is how they made the uranium for
the first nuclear weapon used in war. This

0:29:12.720,0:29:16.529
was the bomb at Hiroshima. It was called "Little
Boy," and they never tested it, because they

0:29:16.529,0:29:17.499
already knew it was going to work.

0:29:17.499,0:29:22.850
Then they said, "Well, what can we do with
all this junk uranium-238, the 99.3 percent

0:29:22.850,0:29:27.299
of it?" Well, Seaborg had already figured
out you could expose it to neutrons, and you

0:29:27.299,0:29:29.649
could make it into Plutonium.

0:29:29.649,0:29:35.239
After a short cooling-off period, the now
highly irradiated fuel rods were transported

0:29:35.239,0:29:38.119
to T-plant in Hanford's 200 area.

0:29:38.119,0:29:43.669
Now, plutonium is a different chemical element
than uranium, so they can be chemically separated.

0:29:43.669,0:29:49.929
The process yielded minute amounts of plutonium.
By weight, the most expensive material on

0:29:49.929,0:29:50.659
the planet.

0:29:50.659,0:29:56.789
And chemically separating things is like a
bazillion times easier than isotopically separating

0:29:56.789,0:29:57.929
it. Because uranium-235 and uranium-238 are
identical chemically. There's no chemical

0:29:57.929,0:29:59.019
difference between them. But there is a chemical
difference between plutonium and uranium,

0:29:59.019,0:30:02.580
so it was a lot easier to do a chemical separation
of the plutonium you'd made.

0:30:02.580,0:30:07.440
And that's how they made the first nuclear
weapon, the Trinity blast in New Mexico, and

0:30:07.440,0:30:11.730
that's also how they made the Nagasaki bomb,
Fat Man. Seaborg says, "OK, well, maybe we

0:30:11.730,0:30:15.759
can do the same thing with Thorium. Maybe
we can expose it to neutrons, and we can make

0:30:15.759,0:30:22.279
it into uranium-233. Uranium will be chemically
separable from Thorium, and we can go make

0:30:22.279,0:30:23.649
a bomb out of it." Right? Sounds great.

0:30:23.649,0:30:28.489
So they started looking at it, and it turns
out, no, it's a really bad idea, because as

0:30:28.489,0:30:34.489
you made the uranium-233, you were always
making uranium-232. Here's the decay chain

0:30:34.489,0:30:41.489
that uranium-232 is on. It jumps down one
year, three days, 55 seconds, 0.16 seconds,

0:30:42.619,0:30:49.440
and it jumps down to these guys - bismuth-212,
thallium-208 and these two decay products

0:30:49.440,0:30:50.879
have harder gamma emission.

0:30:50.879,0:30:56.850
They put out very, very strong gamma rays.
And these gamma rays are super bad news if

0:30:56.850,0:31:01.119
you want to go and build a practical nuclear
device. Because, number one they kill you

0:31:01.119,0:31:04.649
when you work on them, number two, they tell
everybody who's got gamma ray detectors where

0:31:04.649,0:31:05.830
the stuff is.

0:31:05.830,0:31:10.259
So really quickly they were going, OK, we
can work with uranium-235, that seems OK,

0:31:10.259,0:31:15.929
we can work with plutonium, that seems OK,
but this uranium-233 stuff has bad news for

0:31:15.929,0:31:17.739
making a nuclear weapon.

0:31:17.739,0:31:23.389
Thorium was set aside as a potential nuclear
weapons fuel all during the war. After the

0:31:23.389,0:31:26.629
war, they picked up on this again because
now they were thinking, "Let's talk about

0:31:26.629,0:31:32.549
making power instead of making nuclear weapons."
This is a chart that shows absorption propensity

0:31:32.549,0:31:36.369
of each of these different nuclear fuels as
a function of neutron energy.

0:31:36.369,0:31:40.830
This is what's called thermal energy, this
means they've been slowed way down. This is

0:31:40.830,0:31:45.619
fast energy, that means a neutron is still
going really fast. Look how much bigger the

0:31:45.619,0:31:50.070
cross sections are in thermal than they are
in fast.

0:31:50.070,0:31:55.039
What's this guy down here, this is fast times
25. Taking this row, because you can barely

0:31:55.039,0:32:01.389
see these little bitty dots, and I've blown
it up by a factor 25. You can see some proportions

0:32:01.389,0:32:05.269
here. Now what these colors mean is the red
means that it's going to absorb the neutron

0:32:05.269,0:32:08.369
and the blue means that it's going to absorb
the neutron and fission.

0:32:08.369,0:32:12.159
What you want, you want blue. Thick blue is
good. Well, lots of blue, because when you

0:32:12.159,0:32:14.739
hit these dudes with neutron, you want them
fission.

0:32:14.739,0:32:20.690
Look at plutonium, wow, big target, right?
But one third of the time it's just going

0:32:20.690,0:32:26.330
to eat the neutron in thermal fission. That's
not good. On the other hand, in fast fission,

0:32:26.330,0:32:32.700
look at that, wow, was going to fission almost
all the time. We like that was, but look how

0:32:32.700,0:32:37.499
many these little dots we are going to need
to add up to this size. We are going to need

0:32:37.499,0:32:38.429
a lot.

0:32:38.429,0:32:45.119
How much energy did the neutron have that
you smack the nuclear fuel with? How energy

0:32:45.119,0:32:50.389
did they have and then how many neutrons did
you kick out when you smack it to fission?

0:32:50.389,0:32:56.070
These little bitty dots, they appear in this
part of the curve. This is the fast region,

0:32:56.070,0:32:59.749
this is the thermal region. On the thermal
region, look who is doing the best, look at

0:32:59.749,0:33:06.749
uranium-233, about 2.3. Look at plutonium,
is that deep low two right there. That's what

0:33:09.169,0:33:14.999
makes it that you cannot burn up uranium-238
in a thermal-spectrum reactor like a water

0:33:14.999,0:33:17.220
cooled reactor like a CANDU or like a water
reactor.

0:33:17.220,0:33:23.129
You just can't do it. So they look at that
and say, man, we just can't burn uraniun-238

0:33:23.129,0:33:26.789
in the thermal reactor. It just can't be done.
These guys aren't deterred, they said, "Well,

0:33:26.789,0:33:28.799
here is what we'll do, we'll just build a
fast reactor, because look how good it gets

0:33:28.799,0:33:33.609
in the fast region, wow, it gets above two,
three, wow! This is really good!" This was

0:33:33.609,0:33:39.190
the genesis of the idea of the fast breeder
reactor, a reactor that was based around having

0:33:39.190,0:33:42.320
fast neutrons and plutonium fuel.

0:33:42.320,0:33:47.480
But uranium-233 on the other hand, OK, it
gets a little better in the fast, but dang

0:33:47.480,0:33:50.019
it's still pretty damn good right in the thermal.

0:33:50.019,0:33:55.779
Big targets, a lot easier, everybody who is
pushing thorium said, "We like thermal. This

0:33:55.779,0:33:59.710
is the kind of reactor we want to build" and
everybody who is pushing plutonium said, "No,

0:33:59.710,0:34:03.019
no, no, we want a fast reactor, that's the
only way to do it."

0:34:03.019,0:34:06.480
What did we really do, we didn't do either
one of these. In reality, all our reactors

0:34:06.480,0:34:12.660
today are burning uranium-235 which is like
burning platinum, very, very, very rare. We

0:34:12.660,0:34:17.510
didn't take either one of these paths ultimately.
This was the great division in the beginning,

0:34:17.510,0:34:19.960
was it going to thorium or is it going to
be plutonium.

0:34:19.960,0:34:25.120
Wigner was not successful in convincing the
bulk of the nuclear community to take the

0:34:25.120,0:34:30.470
thorium approach. They by and large said,
"We're going to go the plutonium route." One

0:34:30.470,0:34:35.590
of the reasons why was they had developed
a great deal of understanding about plutonium

0:34:35.590,0:34:40.280
from the weapons program. They had made the
stuff. They had worked with its chemistry.

0:34:40.280,0:34:46.860
They'd made fuel out of it. They go, "We get
this. Thorium? We haven't really messed with

0:34:46.860,0:34:49.960
thorium. It would be like starting over."

0:34:49.960,0:34:55.000
That propensity there was to go and do what
you already knew how to do. The plutonium

0:34:55.000,0:35:01.080
was so much better developed than the thorium.
So, Wigner was not terribly successful in

0:35:01.080,0:35:06.990
making converts in the nuclear community.
He did make one convert - Alvin Weinberg.

0:35:06.990,0:35:10.000
He was his student during the Manhattan Project.

0:35:10.000,0:35:14.650
Weinberg got it. He got the big picture. "We
need thorium. We need thorium reactor. We

0:35:14.650,0:35:19.500
need liquid fuel. I see it. I see what we've
got to do." Weinberg got a job offer to be

0:35:19.500,0:35:25.370
the director of Oak Ridge National Labs in
1955. He was 35 years old. He was a year younger

0:35:25.370,0:35:30.090
than I am. I'm sitting there going, "Dude,
when Weinberg was my age he was running Oak

0:35:30.090,0:35:34.200
Ridge National Lab. What am I doing? I'm in
a basement somewhere."

0:35:34.200,0:35:35.130
[laughter]

0:35:35.130,0:35:37.890
I'm just teasing.

0:35:37.890,0:35:38.810
[laughter]

0:35:38.810,0:35:43.420
It's not my mom's basement so I feel better.

0:35:43.420,0:35:48.460
So he goes to Oak Ridge and Wigner said, "Alvin,
you've got to go there because you've got

0:35:48.460,0:35:53.490
to go see if you can make this thorium work.
It's that important." Alvin got it.

0:35:53.490,0:35:58.410
Here was a quote from his book. He said, "Until
then I had never quite appreciated the full

0:35:58.410,0:36:02.330
significance of the breeder." When he's talking
about breeder he actually means the thorium

0:36:02.330,0:36:08.750
reactor. "But now I became obsessed with the
idea that humanity's whole future depended

0:36:08.750,0:36:14.710
on the breeder." The idea that if you don't
go and access the energies of thorium, we're

0:36:14.710,0:36:18.180
not going to make it. We can't make it on
the uranium-235.

0:36:18.180,0:36:21.290
One of the first things that happened when
he got to Oak Ridge, the Atomic Energy Commission

0:36:21.290,0:36:25.210
called him up and said, "You're done in the
reactor business. We're giving all the reactor

0:36:25.210,0:36:30.830
work to Argon National Labs in Chicago and
you guys aren't part of the deal anymore."

0:36:30.830,0:36:35.160
Argon National Labs was fully going for the
plutonium fast breeder. That was there whole

0:36:35.160,0:36:37.080
thing was to do the plutonium fast breeder.

0:36:37.080,0:36:42.290
Right off the bat, Weinberg was like, "Oh
my gosh! What are we going to do?" About that

0:36:42.290,0:36:47.750
time, the Air Force said, "The navy has built
their nuclear submarines and the Army has

0:36:47.750,0:36:52.290
come along and they have taken the same technology
as the Navy, the water cooled reactor. They're

0:36:52.290,0:36:57.210
doing their thing, but the Air Force wants
to build a nuclear powered bomber." Does that

0:36:57.210,0:36:58.400
just sound crazy?

0:36:58.400,0:36:58.800
[laughter]

0:36:58.800,0:37:00.840
It was just absolutely nuts.

0:37:00.840,0:37:06.570
Weinberg was a practical man and he said,
"Hah, nuclear powered bomber? That is probably

0:37:06.570,0:37:09.150
a really dumb idea."

0:37:09.150,0:37:11.530
But the military has a lot of money, "It wasn't
that I'd suddenly become converted to a belief

0:37:11.530,0:37:11.800
in nuclear airplanes. It was rather this was
the only avenue open for ORNL for continuing

0:37:11.800,0:37:16.640
in reactor development. That the purpose was
unattainable if not foolish was not so important."

0:37:16.640,0:37:17.870
[laughter]

0:37:17.870,0:37:24.640
"A high temperature reactor could be useful
for other purposes even if it never propelled

0:37:24.640,0:37:26.410
an airplane." He knew that to make the nuclear
airplane work, they couldn't use water cooled

0:37:26.410,0:37:30.330
reactors. They couldn't use high pressure
reactors. They couldn't use complicated solid

0:37:30.330,0:37:35.620
fuel reactors. They had to have something
that was so slick, that was so safe, that

0:37:35.620,0:37:40.170
was so simple, that operated at low pressure-high
temperature, and had all the features you

0:37:40.170,0:37:41.950
wanted in it. They didn't even know what it
was.

0:37:41.950,0:37:48.260
If this nuclear airplane program had not been
established, the molten salt reactor would

0:37:48.260,0:37:54.880
have never been invented, because it is simply
too radical, too different, too completely

0:37:54.880,0:38:00.380
out of the ball field of everything else for
it to be arrived at through an evolutionary

0:38:00.380,0:38:06.720
development. It had to be forced into existence
by requirements that were so difficult to

0:38:06.720,0:38:09.160
achieve, and then nuclear airplane was that.

0:38:09.160,0:38:13.190
So they began working on this high temperature
reactor, and here was their notion. This reactor

0:38:13.190,0:38:13.440
was going to produce this high temperature
heat. It was going to be ducted into a turbo

0:38:13.420,0:38:13.800
jet engine. The air was going to be sucked
in, compressed. Then instead of a burner here

0:38:13.800,0:38:14.050
that would be injecting fuel, like a combustion
system, you would have this heat exchanger

0:38:13.980,0:38:14.230
with a reactor. It would make the air hot,
then the air would exhaust through the turbine

0:38:13.980,0:38:14.230
and make thrust.

0:38:13.980,0:38:14.230
So it's the same idea as a jet engine, it's
just the heat source was the reactor rather

0:38:14.020,0:38:16.060
than the combustion of fuel. Remember this
was invented before we had ICBMs or anything

0:38:16.060,0:38:20.040
like that. This was a doomsday weapon. If
you're flying this thing to Russia, it's the

0:38:20.040,0:38:23.890
end of the world. So they didn't even know
what kind of reactor this would be, and they

0:38:23.890,0:38:27.040
began working and came up with the molten
salt concept.

0:38:27.040,0:38:30.550
They didn't know if it would work, so this
built this proof of principle reactor, called

0:38:30.550,0:38:35.720
the Aircraft Reactor Experiment. They circulated
the liquid fluoride salt in these tubes to

0:38:35.720,0:38:38.230
produce two and a half megawatts of thermal
power.

0:38:38.230,0:38:44.420
Xenon is a gas. What happens to gases in a
liquid. The gaseous fission product xenon

0:38:44.420,0:38:45.470
just came right out of the salt.

0:38:45.470,0:38:50.690
Can you imagine if what happened to poor Wigner
in his Washington reactor happened to the

0:38:50.690,0:38:54.930
dude flying to Russia? He'd be like, "This
is your captain speaking. We're going to have

0:38:54.930,0:38:58.570
to make an emergency landing over Siberia.
Xenon level's just getting a little too high

0:38:58.570,0:39:02.330
in the reactor back there, so we're just going
to set down on the tundra here for nine hours

0:39:02.330,0:39:07.470
while that old xenon's going to come on down.
We'll be lighting up and taking off shortly."

0:39:07.470,0:39:08.390
You know, I mean that's not going to work.

0:39:08.390,0:39:11.120
And it ran for about 11 days in 1954.

0:39:11.120,0:39:15.140
It reached the highest temperatures that had
ever been achieved by a nuclear reactor up

0:39:15.140,0:39:16.370
to that point.

0:39:16.370,0:39:21.440
And proved to them that, essentially, their
notion was correct - that you could sustain

0:39:21.440,0:39:26.250
nuclear fission reactions inside a salt, that
it would operate at high temperature and low

0:39:26.250,0:39:30.810
pressure, that it was very stable. And the
reason why it was so stable was, as the salt

0:39:30.810,0:39:35.900
would heat up, there would be less fissile
material in the nuclear reactor core, and

0:39:35.900,0:39:38.020
so fission became less likely.

0:39:38.020,0:39:42.500
Conversely, as the salt cooled down, there
was more material, because the salt was contracting,

0:39:42.500,0:39:43.920
and fission became more likely.

0:39:43.920,0:39:46.830
The engineers out there, that's a dynamically
stable system.

0:39:46.830,0:39:49.450
It gets hotter, cools down, gets too cool,
heats up.

0:39:49.450,0:39:55.530
Well, by this time it was about 1960. ICBMs
were going great. We'd perfected air to air

0:39:55.530,0:39:58.960
refueling. The Air Force was going, "Oh, man,
you know, I don't think we really need that

0:39:58.960,0:40:00.930
nuclear bomber anymore."

0:40:00.930,0:40:04.400
Weinberg petitioned the Atomic Energy Commission
in the United States for money and he got

0:40:04.400,0:40:09.590
a little bit. He got enough to build a demonstration
reactor that was supposed to be less than

0:40:09.590,0:40:12.860
10 megawatts. They built it, and it was called
the Molten Salt Reactors Experiment. It ran

0:40:12.860,0:40:14.640
from 1965 to 1969.

0:40:14.640,0:40:19.070
It turned out that thorium was a great fit
in this reactor.

0:40:19.070,0:40:22.520
This is what's called a two fluid, molten
salt reactor design.

0:40:22.520,0:40:25.990
What is molten salt reactor in relation to
LFTR and vice versa?

0:40:25.990,0:40:30.860
LFTR is a molten salt reactor. All LFTRs are
molten salt reactors but not all molten salt

0:40:30.860,0:40:31.810
reactors are LFTRs.

0:40:31.810,0:40:37.690
You've got this core fluid, a lithium beryllium
salt, with uranium tetrafluoride in there.

0:40:37.690,0:40:41.160
Now what you want to do is you want to move
that fuel you've made from the blanket into

0:40:41.160,0:40:45.740
the core. And here's how you do it. You take
this stream of this blanket salt off and you

0:40:45.740,0:40:48.850
put it in this fluoride volatility column.

0:40:48.850,0:40:54.930
You hit the salt with fluorine gas, and what'll
happen is... Uranium has two kinds of fluorine

0:40:54.930,0:41:00.540
states it'll be in. There's uranium tetrafluoride,
four fluoride ions, and there's uranium hexafluoride,

0:41:00.540,0:41:02.780
six fluoride ions.

0:41:02.780,0:41:04.270
Uranium hexafluoride is a gas.

0:41:04.270,0:41:06.650
Uranium tetrafluoride is in solution.

0:41:06.650,0:41:11.000
If you hit it with fluorine it will start
to bubble out of the salt, just like bubbles

0:41:11.000,0:41:15.160
in your pop. And that's great because this
is a neat trick. This is a way to get your

0:41:15.160,0:41:19.210
uranium product to come out of the blanket
and leave everything behind.

0:41:19.210,0:41:25.100
This wouldn't work if thorium also had this
same trick. If thorium would turn into a hexafluoride

0:41:25.100,0:41:29.780
in a gas, we'd be up the creek. But this is
one of these little miracles of nature.

0:41:29.780,0:41:33.370
So you can sit there and pound thorium with
fluoride all you want. It's not going to change.

0:41:33.370,0:41:39.020
It's going to stay in solution. But the uranium
will come out as uranium hexafluoride, a gas.

0:41:39.020,0:41:42.690
Well now you need to move it into the core
salts. So you bring a stream of core salt

0:41:42.690,0:41:47.810
over here and you introduce this uranium hexafluoride
here. And now you hit it with a little hydrogen

0:41:47.810,0:41:48.780
gas.

0:41:48.780,0:41:54.680
The hydrogen will say to UF6, "Hey man, I
want those two fluorines a whole lot worse

0:41:54.680,0:42:01.380
than you do." Ahh! UF6 gets stuck up at the
gas station, has to give up two fluorines

0:42:01.380,0:42:05.460
you know and drops from UF6 back to UF4. Whoop!
It's in solution now.

0:42:05.460,0:42:11.210
So now, you've just refueled your core salt
with uranium tetrafluoride. Cool trick, huh?

0:42:11.210,0:42:15.670
You're continuously refueling your reactor,
all the time. You're always refueling the

0:42:15.670,0:42:21.980
core with new uranium-233. And uranium-233
is being consumed but the neutrons from the

0:42:21.980,0:42:23.770
fission are making new uranium-233.

0:42:23.770,0:42:29.820
OK, well out of the top of this column comes
hydrofluoric acid - HF. You send that down

0:42:29.820,0:42:34.490
to this electrolyzer unit. And you hit it
with some electricity and the HF will split

0:42:34.490,0:42:39.950
into hydrogen gas and fluorine gas. And guess
what - now you've regenerated your two reactants.

0:42:39.950,0:42:44.770
So your fluorine and your hydrogen are ready
for duty again to make this trick work.

0:42:44.770,0:42:48.410
This is a piece you can actually buy off the
shelf. So this is pretty cool! This is a closed

0:42:48.410,0:42:55.410
cycle for how to get your new fuel from here
into here. You're essentially converting thorium

0:42:56.650,0:43:00.880
into energy. First into U233, and then into
energy through fission. Now of course you're

0:43:00.880,0:43:05.150
using up some thorium doing this. So you need
to have a little feed of thorium fluoride,

0:43:05.150,0:43:09.090
you need to feed some new thorium into the
blanket to make up for the thorium you are

0:43:09.090,0:43:11.070
consuming. But a very efficient reaction.

0:43:11.070,0:43:14.370
Let me introduce you to a typical nuclear
reactor.

0:43:14.370,0:43:18.480
Watts Bar Plant in Tennessee, I've actually
been to this nuclear reactor before. This

0:43:18.480,0:43:23.080
has a distinction of being the newest nuclear
reactor in the United States. This came online

0:43:23.080,0:43:28.460
in 1996.
A big pressurized water reactor vessel. 150

0:43:28.460,0:43:33.400
atmospheres, solid nuclear fuel. Fission is
going on. Water is being pumped through. It's

0:43:33.400,0:43:37.050
getting hotter. This water then goes through
a steam generator and in another loop of water

0:43:37.050,0:43:41.900
steam is being raised. It goes to the turbine,
spins the turbine, which spins the generator

0:43:41.900,0:43:43.200
makes electricity.

0:43:43.200,0:43:46.390
This is the steam turbine. And when I was
at Watts Bar this is the part I got to go

0:43:46.390,0:43:46.970
see.

0:43:46.970,0:43:53.970
There was not a skitch of dust on anything!
Now, if any of you have been to a coal plant

0:43:54.500,0:43:59.410
and seen the same steam turbine, because they
use the same technology at a coal plant. It

0:43:59.410,0:44:06.410
is nothing like this. A coal plant is dirty,
it's smelly, it's filthy, and it's dripping.

0:44:06.900,0:44:10.370
This thing was almost antiseptic in the way
it look.

0:44:10.370,0:44:10.620
Is there a need for that?

0:44:10.370,0:44:17.370
I don't know. So I'm standing next to this
machine. You can't really see a person, about

0:44:17.840,0:44:19.550
yay high here.

0:44:19.550,0:44:25.860
This is this low-pressure turbine. And this
is turning the shaft that's running this.

0:44:25.860,0:44:29.960
Now in front of this guy is this little thing
called the high-pressure turbine. And you

0:44:29.960,0:44:30.700
can't really see it. You see the big three
low-pressure turbines but you don't see the

0:44:30.700,0:44:32.090
high-pressure turbine. The high pressure turbine
is little bitty. It's like a third the size

0:44:32.090,0:44:37.200
of the generator. The high-pressure turbine
is making about two-thirds of the torque that's

0:44:37.200,0:44:38.310
turning the shaft.

0:44:38.310,0:44:42.490
And the low-pressure turbines are making about
one-third of the torque that's turning the

0:44:42.490,0:44:46.790
shaft. This little guy is doing almost all
the work and these big, big, big guys are

0:44:46.790,0:44:47.930
hardly doing anything.

0:44:47.930,0:44:51.740
When the steam goes into the high-pressure
turbine, it's dense. It's got a lot of energy

0:44:51.740,0:44:55.980
and a little volume. But then you let it blow
down as it goes across the high pressure turbine

0:44:55.980,0:44:58.000
and becomes low-pressure steam.

0:44:58.000,0:45:02.670
That's why these machines have to be so darn
big. Because the steam that's heating them

0:45:02.670,0:45:07.200
has already lost the vast majority of the
energy that it's going to give up.

0:45:07.200,0:45:12.380
This is the reactor itself, the reactor vessel
up here is where all the control rods slide

0:45:12.380,0:45:16.840
in and out of the core. And then there's these
four steam generators, as big if not bigger

0:45:16.840,0:45:20.190
than the reactors and they also have to operate
at these very high pressures.

0:45:20.190,0:45:27.190
There's four of them. Look at that. One, two,
three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Big

0:45:27.430,0:45:28.280
pipes.

0:45:28.280,0:45:32.630
The number one accident people worry about
with this kind of reactor is what's called

0:45:32.630,0:45:38.460
the double-ended pipe break. One of these
eight pipes, for whatever reason, shears.

0:45:38.460,0:45:44.600
And all of a sudden, pressure is lost in the
reactor. That water that's being held water

0:45:44.600,0:45:51.490
at 300 Celsius by 150 atmospheres of pressure,
when you lose pressure it flashes to steam,

0:45:51.490,0:45:57.070
almost instantly to steam. And when that happens,
its volume increases roughly by a factor of

0:45:57.070,0:46:02.330
1,000. So what was yay dense is now not so
dense anymore.

0:46:02.330,0:46:07.600
The other thing that happens is steam doesn't
take away heat nearly as well as liquid water

0:46:07.600,0:46:12.960
does from a surface. So all of a sudden your
fuel rods are not being cooled nearly as effectively

0:46:12.960,0:46:17.030
as they were before. Now fission will stop
because one of the things the water is doing

0:46:17.030,0:46:21.400
is slowing down the neutrons. So without the
water the fission reaction stops. You don't

0:46:21.400,0:46:27.550
have to put control rods in or anything. The
reactor will turn off immediately. But it

0:46:27.550,0:46:30.470
will still be generating heat from those fission
products.

0:46:30.470,0:46:35.810
Here's what'll happen if you have a double-ended
pipe break. You get this entire containment

0:46:35.810,0:46:36.890
vessel filled with water.

0:46:36.890,0:46:41.010
Now, I don't want to tell you all this because
I'm trying to focus on negative situations

0:46:41.010,0:46:44.870
here. I'm telling you this because this is
what drives the design of this building. This

0:46:44.870,0:46:51.660
building is the size it is and it's the way
it is precisely to accommodate this event.

0:46:51.660,0:46:57.650
They've designed this reactor so if this happens,
all the steam is captured in this building

0:46:57.650,0:46:58.750
and doesn't get out.

0:46:58.750,0:47:03.060
Look at the size of the reactor. Look at the
size of the containment building. It's huge.

0:47:03.060,0:47:09.150
It's much bigger than the reactor and it's
all driven by that thousand to one difference

0:47:09.150,0:47:14.830
in the density between steam and liquid water.
Now if this happens, you have to figure out

0:47:14.830,0:47:21.060
a way to get water back on the fuel rods to
cool them. So they have a series of emergency

0:47:21.060,0:47:25.380
systems in this reactor and they operate at
all different stages of pressure.

0:47:25.380,0:47:28.200
So the idea is if you're still at high pressure
and you've got to get water in there, we've

0:47:28.200,0:47:31.210
got a system for that. If you've lost some
of your pressure and you've got to get water

0:47:31.210,0:47:34.460
in there, we've got a system for that. If
you've lost all your pressure and we've got

0:47:34.460,0:47:37.900
to get water in there, we've got a system
for that. So there's a lot of systems and

0:47:37.900,0:47:42.200
then there's backups to those systems, and
it's all driven by this high pressure and

0:47:42.200,0:47:43.450
by the use of water.

0:47:43.450,0:47:43.920
Yes sir?

0:47:43.920,0:47:49.100
Does the control rod missile shield to keep
the control rods from punching a hole through

0:47:49.100,0:47:53.550
the roof if the steam explosion reaches the
reactor chamber?

0:47:53.550,0:47:58.340
Precisely. Here's the control rod drive mechanism.
Here's the rods. If you breach this part,

0:47:58.340,0:48:03.450
let's say the welding failed, and this thing
goes "boom" and out shoot the control rods,

0:48:03.450,0:48:07.020
that's there to keep them from doing bad things
like punching a hole in the top.

0:48:07.020,0:48:12.300
That actually did happen one time. That was
an army reactor and they did not have a containment

0:48:12.300,0:48:16.410
building. One poor guy got impaled to the
ceiling by a control rod so...

0:48:16.410,0:48:18.530
That's got to be the coolest way to die.

0:48:18.530,0:48:21.900
That was a real bad day. If he didn't get
impaled the radiation was going to get him.

0:48:21.900,0:48:26.810
The pinhole camera spotted several locations
and sources of high gamma radiation activity

0:48:26.810,0:48:33.170
outside the reactor vessel presumably from
reactor components blown from the core by

0:48:33.170,0:48:34.920
the force of the 500 PSI explosion.

0:48:34.920,0:48:38.480
The reactor vessel is about nine inch thick
steel. When you've got nine inch thick steel

0:48:38.480,0:48:42.460
and it has to be nuclear grade and it has
to be perfect, you can't go and weld nine

0:48:42.460,0:48:46.850
inch thick steel. They don't make it that
way. They forge it in one piece. Not a lot

0:48:46.850,0:48:53.800
of people have the capability to build a 10-meter
diameter, 20-meter long, single piece, nine

0:48:53.800,0:48:57.920
inch thick forging. In fact, there's exactly
one place in the world you can build this.

0:48:57.920,0:49:00.670
It's a place called Japan Steel Works in Japan.

0:49:00.670,0:49:03.320
It's a limiting factor because you say "I
want to build lots and lots of nuclear reactors."

0:49:03.320,0:49:07.670
Either you're going to build a new heavy forging,
which is really just for this task, or you're

0:49:07.670,0:49:11.460
going to wait a long time to get your reactor
in line to go do this.

0:49:11.460,0:49:14.160
Let me diss on water a few more times.

0:49:14.160,0:49:16.960
Here's why water is not such a great thing
for the inside of a nuclear reactor. Number

0:49:16.960,0:49:22.430
one, it can't hack the temperature, we already
talked about that. Number two, it's a covalently

0:49:22.430,0:49:27.790
bonded substance. The oxygen has a covalent
bond with two hydrogens. Neither one of those

0:49:27.790,0:49:33.440
bonds is strong enough to survive getting
smacked around by a gamma or a neutron. They're

0:49:33.440,0:49:37.600
just going too fast. Sure enough, they knock
the hydrogens clean off.

0:49:37.600,0:49:42.310
Now, in a water cooled reactor, you have a
system called a recombiner that will take

0:49:42.310,0:49:47.890
the hydrogen gas and the oxygen gas that is
always being created from the nuclear reaction

0:49:47.890,0:49:51.740
and put them back together, because chemically
they'd much rather be water than being hydrogen

0:49:51.740,0:49:56.420
and oxygen. It's a great system as long as
it's operating and the system is pumping.

0:49:56.420,0:50:01.030
Well, at Fukushima Daiichi, the problem was
that the pumping power stopped. When the pumping

0:50:01.030,0:50:07.140
power stopped, water was still getting busted
apart. Hydrogen is real light, and even though

0:50:07.140,0:50:11.780
it wants to get with oxygen again it will
dissociate fairly quickly. The hydrogen will

0:50:11.780,0:50:15.430
sit at the top of the vessel and the oxygen
will sit in a layer below it, and then there's

0:50:15.430,0:50:16.200
the water.

0:50:16.200,0:50:20.630
The designers of that particular reactor had
intentionally designed it so that you would

0:50:20.630,0:50:24.830
vent the hydrogen outside of the containment
building. This has always been kind of controversial.

0:50:24.830,0:50:29.310
They ducted the hydrogen up to the upper decks
of the reactor, which were outside the containment.

0:50:29.310,0:50:33.870
They're just kind of a sparse steel frame
structure up there. And one, two, three, we

0:50:33.870,0:50:38.460
say it happen on the news. First one filled
with hydrogen, got to a certain point, boom.

0:50:38.460,0:50:41.620
The news said, "Oh, We had a nuclear explosion.",
and I'm like, "No, we didn't. It wasn't a

0:50:41.620,0:50:44.720
nuclear explosion. It was a hydrogen gas explosion."
It didn't burst the containment.

0:50:44.720,0:50:49.690
I don't want to diminish it too much but it
was not nearly as scary as it sounded. It

0:50:49.690,0:50:51.420
happened one, two, three.

0:50:51.420,0:50:56.900
The tsunami hit about an hour after the reactors
were shut down. Fission was long gone by the

0:50:56.900,0:51:01.130
time the tsunami came along. But the reactors
were still managing decay heat. The tsunami

0:51:01.130,0:51:05.000
came and destroyed the diesel generators,
but they still had batteries and those batteries

0:51:05.000,0:51:06.810
ran for about eight hours.

0:51:06.810,0:51:10.790
That eight hours was the most important time
of all. If you had to pick eight hours to

0:51:10.790,0:51:14.350
make sure that the pumps were still working,
those first eight hours were the most important

0:51:14.350,0:51:18.760
time. By the time the batteries ran dry and
the pumps stopped, the reactor had gotten

0:51:18.760,0:51:24.230
past the worst part of its decay heat comedown.
It was still going on, decay heat doesn't

0:51:24.230,0:51:28.370
turn off, and it continues even in spent fuel.
That decay heat continued to build. Heat was

0:51:28.370,0:51:30.160
not being removed from the reactor.

0:51:30.160,0:51:32.840
Why weren't they using the power from the
reactor to run the pumps? Because the reactor

0:51:32.840,0:51:33.400
had been turned off.

0:51:33.400,0:51:38.360
This shows if you do stupid designs, something
bad will happen, even after 40 years. A friend

0:51:38.360,0:51:42.620
of mine was GE's first nuclear safety engineer
and he worked on the Fukushima plant, and

0:51:42.620,0:51:46.860
they would have meetings with the TEPCO officials
and engineers and they would all nod their

0:51:46.860,0:51:50.750
heads in long meetings and say "We'll do this,
we'll do that," and then they go off after

0:51:50.750,0:51:55.620
the meeting and do whatever they wanted. That's
why you had a 15-foot sea wall with a 45-foot

0:51:55.620,0:51:58.850
wave coming over, and diesel generators and
fuel in the basement.

0:51:58.850,0:52:02.940
It has nothing to do with nuclear power, it
has to do with bad management and you wouldn't

0:52:02.940,0:52:09.940
even design a simple factory the way that
was designed. I'm sure you could talk to the

0:52:11.550,0:52:15.750
Japanese representative here about TEPCO's
management getting kicked out years ago for

0:52:15.750,0:52:18.290
fraud and other things. They've had a history.

0:52:18.290,0:52:23.170
Let me talk about today's nuclear fuel, because
that is common to both boiling water reactors,

0:52:23.170,0:52:28.540
pressurized water reactors and CANDUs. This
is a handful of these uranium oxide fuel pellets.

0:52:28.540,0:52:33.630
The guy's got gloves on and it's easy to think
he's got gloves on to protect him from the

0:52:33.630,0:52:37.410
uranium oxide, but now that I've taught you
about the true nature of radioactivity, you

0:52:37.410,0:52:41.030
might go "I'm not so sure that stuff's so
dangerous after all," and you would be correct.

0:52:41.030,0:52:45.630
He is not protecting himself from the uranium,
he's protecting the uranium from himself.

0:52:45.630,0:52:49.910
That stuff has to stay super pure and super
clean and you don't want to get any of your

0:52:49.910,0:52:55.090
oils, or grease or sweat on nuclear fuel that's
going to go inside a fuel rod so that's what

0:52:55.090,0:52:56.330
the gloves are for.

0:52:56.330,0:53:00.660
They take these fuel pellets and slide them
down these zirconium tubes and they actually

0:53:00.660,0:53:05.180
will segregate the pellets along the length
of the fuel assembly according to enrichment.

0:53:05.180,0:53:08.440
They'll put the most enriched ones in the
middle, and then they'll kind of decrease

0:53:08.440,0:53:13.800
the enrichment along the length of the fuel
assemblies. It's really, really expensive

0:53:13.800,0:53:15.930
to fabricate solid fuel.

0:53:15.930,0:53:21.180
Back in the day, their business model for
how to make a nuclear reactor was sometimes

0:53:21.180,0:53:26.540
referred to as a "razor blades business model,"
in other words sell these reactors to utilities

0:53:26.540,0:53:31.670
pretty much at cost in order to lock them
in to a long-term supply contract.

0:53:31.670,0:53:35.500
It was good money for them, because once somebody's
bought your reactor, they're going to buy

0:53:35.500,0:53:39.460
your Westinghouse 17x17 array fuel. They're
not going to go "Hey, GE, what kind of deal

0:53:39.460,0:53:42.240
can you give me on this?" And be told "Dude,
you don't have my reactor." You're working

0:53:42.240,0:53:46.400
with that guy, there's no market out there
once you build the reactor, you're using his

0:53:46.400,0:53:49.630
fuel. If he decides to change the price on
you, well, that's tough.

0:53:49.630,0:53:53.410
Here's the reactor. It's got its lid off,
and then they'll fill the whole thing up to

0:53:53.410,0:53:57.120
a level with water, so they make the whole
thing into a swimming pool. Fill this whole

0:53:57.120,0:54:02.030
thing up with water, because the water is
radiation shielding. They take the fuel assemblies

0:54:02.030,0:54:06.480
out and put it in the spent fuel pool. This
is what they have to do about every 18 months

0:54:06.480,0:54:10.800
to the reactor. They'll take out about a third
of the fuel and then they'll load in about

0:54:10.800,0:54:14.850
a third new fresh fuel and then they'll reshuffle
the fuel that's already been in there. They'll

0:54:14.850,0:54:17.430
move it from the center out to the periphery.

0:54:17.430,0:54:21.170
It's like "Lord of the Rings," "The Great
Eye is looking," no, it's really not in the

0:54:21.170,0:54:26.050
eye. Here is what it really is. It's a cross-section
of nuclear fuel. This is uranium oxide and

0:54:26.050,0:54:30.290
when you put it in a reactor for a while,
one of the things xenon does, it's a gas,

0:54:30.290,0:54:35.610
so it's way, way, way less dense than solid
fuel. When you make this gas, it starts to

0:54:35.610,0:54:38.540
break up the solid structure of the fuel.

0:54:38.540,0:54:43.510
The solid fuel will begin to swell and crack
and the gasses, the krypton and the xenon

0:54:43.510,0:54:47.680
begin to fill up, and you begin to get this
central void. This is actually a gap in the

0:54:47.680,0:54:50.300
fuel. Fission product gasses will accumulate
here.

0:54:50.300,0:54:55.440
Wigner didn't like solid fuel. He was a chemical
engineer by training and he thought, "What

0:54:55.440,0:55:00.200
kind of industrial process do we run chemically
based on solids?" He goes "We don't. Everything

0:55:00.200,0:55:04.740
we do, we use as liquids or gasses because
we can mix them completely." You can take

0:55:04.740,0:55:08.560
a liquid, you can fully mix it. You can take
a gas, you can fully mix it. You can't take

0:55:08.560,0:55:12.490
a solid and fully mix it unless you turn it
into a liquid or a gas.

0:55:12.490,0:55:17.110
To give you an idea, here's what we do today.
We make this solid uranium oxide fuel and

0:55:17.110,0:55:21.600
there's a single pellet, and then we put them
in these big reactor fuel elements, zirconium

0:55:21.600,0:55:24.760
tubes that are like 12 feet long and about
this big around. We then stick them in the

0:55:24.760,0:55:29.660
reactor and irradiate them for a couple of
years. We only burn up a small amount of the

0:55:29.660,0:55:32.910
uranium that's in there, we take it out and
we stick it in a spent fuel pool. It is not

0:55:32.910,0:55:34.010
very efficient.

0:55:34.010,0:55:38.740
The heavy water reactor will use about 0.7
percent energy value and the light water...

0:55:38.740,0:55:44.120
Reactors in the United States, we're extracting
about half of 1 percent of the energy that's

0:55:44.120,0:55:47.750
in the uranium. You can imagine going to your
boss saying "I developed a new system", "Well

0:55:47.750,0:55:53.450
how efficient is it?", "It's less than 1 percent",
"Excuse me, what did you build? I think you

0:55:53.450,0:55:56.460
need to go work on that again," you know.
We just simply wouldn't accept this.

0:55:56.460,0:56:00.640
I'm an engineer. If you're that far off 100
percent, man I want to get a whole lot closer

0:56:00.640,0:56:05.290
and Weinberg did too. They wanted to get to
nearly 100 percent of the energy utilization.

0:56:05.290,0:56:08.710
The molten salt reactor experiment was the
core part of it. They didn't have a blanket

0:56:08.710,0:56:12.480
around it, they just wanted to see if they
could get the first step to work, and they

0:56:12.480,0:56:13.610
were successful.

0:56:13.610,0:56:17.970
After they completed the molten salt reactor
experiment, they went to the Atomic Energy

0:56:17.970,0:56:21.920
Commission they said "Hey, G, can we have
some more money? We'd like to go now and build

0:56:21.920,0:56:27.640
the real thing. We'd like to build the blanket
and hook a power conversion system on and

0:56:27.640,0:56:32.120
make electricity," they felt like they'd shot
the moon. The Atomic Energy Commission unfortunately

0:56:32.120,0:56:34.110
did not share their zeal.

0:56:34.110,0:56:39.160
They had invested very heavily in an alternative
technology, the plutonium fast breeder reactor

0:56:39.160,0:56:46.160
based on solid fuels and turning abundant
uranium-238 into plutonium-239 and then burning

0:56:46.280,0:56:50.800
it in the reactor. It involved a whole different
set of technologies that were much more in

0:56:50.800,0:56:56.770
line with the light water reactors. It's funny,
even at that time 50 years ago, nobody thought

0:56:56.770,0:57:00.850
the light water reactor, the heavy water reactor
would be around very long. They were just

0:57:00.850,0:57:04.740
simply too inefficient in their use of nuclear
fuel.

0:57:04.740,0:57:08.000
Like I was saying, the Atomic Energy Commission
said "Hey, guess what, we're putting all this

0:57:08.000,0:57:12.080
money in the fast breeder. We've got all these
companies lined up to do the fast breeder.

0:57:12.080,0:57:17.720
They even actually built one in Monroe, Michigan.
It had had a meltdown. They were undeterred,

0:57:17.720,0:57:22.140
they were moving forward and so they told
Weinberg to take a hike.

0:57:22.140,0:57:26.330
The story gets a little more complicated too
because in addition to being a thorium guru,

0:57:26.330,0:57:30.860
Weinberg was also the original inventor of
the pressurized water reactor. He had invented

0:57:30.860,0:57:37.680
it and gotten his patent for it in 1947, so
it was a little bit of a tricky thing to have

0:57:37.680,0:57:44.250
the inventor of the light water reactor advocating
for something very, very, very different.

0:57:44.250,0:57:48.410
And got a little worse than that too, because
Weinberg was never really crazy about the

0:57:48.410,0:57:51.430
light water reactor. He didn't like the fact
that it had to run at really high pressure.

0:57:51.430,0:57:57.330
There would be an accident someday where you
were not able to maintain the pressure or

0:57:57.330,0:58:02.800
keep cooling it. There could be a meltdown,
there could be a release of radioactivity.

0:58:02.800,0:58:08.480
Does any of this sound familiar? And he was
making enough of a stink about this that there

0:58:08.480,0:58:10.530
was a congressional leader named Chet Holifield...

0:58:10.530,0:58:13.720
A member of the joint Congressional Atomic
Energy Committee...

0:58:13.720,0:58:18.520
Who told Alvin Weinberg, he said, "If you're
so concerned about the safety of nuclear energy,

0:58:18.520,0:58:23.090
it might be time for you to leave the nuclear
business." He wasn't questioning the value

0:58:23.090,0:58:28.550
or the importance of nuclear energy, if anything
he was far more convinced about that than

0:58:28.550,0:58:29.890
anyone else.

0:58:29.890,0:58:34.800
What he was questioning was whether the right
path been taken in the development of nuclear

0:58:34.800,0:58:39.710
reactors. He was particularly well suited
to make that question because his role as

0:58:39.710,0:58:45.140
inventor of predominant technology so he was
quietly shown the door.

0:58:45.140,0:58:50.480
After he had left Oak Ridge you can imagine
things did not go well for the research team

0:58:50.480,0:58:54.750
the Atomic Energy Commission, commissioned
a report WASH 1222 I like to call it white

0:58:54.750,0:58:56.420
wash 1222.

0:58:56.420,0:59:01.810
Because they really nitpicked on three very,
very small issues about the reactor and said

0:59:01.810,0:59:06.990
look big problems here. I don't think we can
go forward until these are resolved. When

0:59:06.990,0:59:11.940
it came time to talk about the safety and
the performance of the reactor there may be

0:59:11.940,0:59:18.940
some safety advantages that haven't been quantified
yet regarding this approach but you know we

0:59:19.510,0:59:23.080
just really can't be sure about that.

0:59:23.080,0:59:26.570
Just burns me up because I think big, big,
big mistake United States made in walking

0:59:26.570,0:59:27.900
away from this.

0:59:27.900,0:59:31.660
So they put all their chips fast breeder reactor
and that didn't work out too well for them.

0:59:31.660,0:59:35.540
They start building one in Tennessee. The
program ended up in getting canceled by Carter

0:59:35.540,0:59:40.410
in 1979 and was briefly resurrected by Reagan
in 1981 and then cancelled again. So that's

0:59:40.410,0:59:43.760
what happened to fast breed reactor in the
United States, a couple of countries kept

0:59:43.760,0:59:44.280
going with it.

0:59:44.280,0:59:48.720
The French went with it in eighties they built
Phénix and Superphénix and then they ended

0:59:48.720,0:59:52.470
up shutting down there fast breeder too and
the Japanese tried it but they had several

0:59:52.470,0:59:55.720
but one called Monju and it had been shut
down since the mid 90s.

0:59:55.720,0:59:59.490
Then a few months ago they turned it back
on and then somebody dropped a crane in liquid

0:59:59.490,1:00:03.840
sodium and then they shut it off again, so
you know everybody has tried the fast breeder

1:00:03.840,1:00:05.620
reactor. I think the Russian's are trying
it.

1:00:05.620,1:00:09.690
I have some good friends in nuclear industry.
They are very big advocates of the fast breeder

1:00:09.690,1:00:15.050
reactor. The common name for now is the integral
fast reactor. I am not the biggest fan a reactor

1:00:15.050,1:00:19.220
that is full of liquid sodium. If any of you
are chemists in here you probably recall sodium

1:00:19.220,1:00:26.220
has a great infinity for just about everything.

1:00:27.740,1:00:29.740
What are your thoughts on the traveling wave
reactor?

1:00:29.740,1:00:34.120
The traveling wave reactor is another form
of a liquid metal fast breeder reactor. It

1:00:34.120,1:00:38.290
is a particularly difficult implementation
of that reactor. That reactor is already hard

1:00:38.290,1:00:42.590
to build in first place, with the traveling
wave they make it even more complicated by

1:00:42.590,1:00:47.370
saying we are going to leave the fuel in the
reactor for the lifetime of the reactor.

1:00:47.370,1:00:52.880
Physically propagate this deflagration wave,
a nuclear conversion and burning wave. Why

1:00:52.880,1:00:56.880
on Earth would you take such a hard reactor
and make it even harder to what end? What

1:00:56.880,1:01:01.120
is your goal? And all I've been able to read
as far as their goal is that they want to

1:01:01.120,1:01:04.000
never have to recycle or replace the fuel.

1:01:04.000,1:01:07.430
At the end of their life their concept is
to just bury the thing in the ground and leave

1:01:07.430,1:01:12.850
it there. I'm thinking, "You don't leave a
bunch of plutonium in a pool of liquid sodium

1:01:12.850,1:01:17.270
underground for an extended period of time
that is a bad disposal option."

1:01:17.270,1:01:21.400
They have attracted Bill Gate who of course
is an extremely wealthy man. If Bill Gates

1:01:21.400,1:01:24.810
wants to save a lot of money he can get in
touch with me and I think I can talk him out

1:01:24.810,1:01:25.820
of traveling wave.

1:01:25.820,1:01:29.780
He won't return my calls. Don't feel bad.

1:01:29.780,1:01:35.350
I used to be so into fusion, specially helium-3
fusion, mining in the mood. Oh my God! I've

1:01:35.350,1:01:37.360
read so many books about that stuff.

1:01:37.360,1:01:39.850
Fusion is magical. If we make that happen
it would be magical.

1:01:39.850,1:01:43.780
I took this fusion class when I was at Georgia
Tech and I will never forget it. We started

1:01:43.780,1:01:46.230
studying and I go, "Man, this is really hard."

1:01:46.230,1:01:50.930
Charged particles don't want to get near each
other. Bare nuclei are both charged, positive

1:01:50.930,1:01:52.240
charged, they want to avoid each other.

1:01:52.240,1:01:55.490
And my professor had a really great way of
putting it. "It's like going to the mini golf."

1:01:55.490,1:01:59.050
He says, "You know how in mini golf you've
got the volcano, and the volcano's got the

1:01:59.050,1:02:02.870
hole at the very top, and you've got to putt
your ball in a way that it goes all the way

1:02:02.870,1:02:07.990
up the side of the volcano, and 'phwep!' falls
in the hole." He goes, "OK. That's like fusion.

1:02:07.990,1:02:12.570
The ball is like a nucleus, and the volcano
is the scattering effect.

1:02:12.570,1:02:16.570
So any time you want to have a nucleus go
to another nucleus, it scatters; it rolls

1:02:16.570,1:02:19.830
up the mountain and it rolls down the side,
it rolls over here, over there... and only

1:02:19.830,1:02:23.770
when you just perfectly get it on the right
angle does it go in the volcano." Now, the

1:02:23.770,1:02:27.030
problem with fusion, he goes, "You can't steer
the ball, you have to have enough temperature

1:02:27.030,1:02:30.600
so that it can make it all the way up the
side of the volcano and fall in, and then

1:02:30.600,1:02:34.030
you have to have enough balls because you
can't steer them there at the mini golf park",

1:02:34.030,1:02:37.760
that's density, "and then because they're
flying all over the place, you've got to make

1:02:37.760,1:02:40.500
sure that there's a fence around the mini
golf park so that they don't get away." That's

1:02:40.500,1:02:40.810
confinement.

1:02:40.810,1:02:45.240
He said, "Those are your three things, density,
temperature, and confinement, to make fusion

1:02:45.240,1:02:45.490
happen."

1:02:45.440,1:02:49.350
I said, "Dude, that's really hard!" So, I
came up with another analogy, "So, I guess

1:02:49.350,1:02:54.500
fission would be like the mini golf park except
now the volcano was flush, the hole was about

1:02:54.500,1:02:58.580
this big around, the balls are going slow,
and every time the ball goes in the hole,

1:02:58.580,1:02:59.860
two more balls come out."

1:02:59.860,1:03:02.800
He goes, "Yeah, that's pretty good."

1:03:02.800,1:03:07.870
I've looked at focus fusion, I've looked at
steam-piston fusion, I've looked at D-helium-3

1:03:07.870,1:03:11.590
and P-boron, and all these other kind of things
and I'm still going, "I'm just not buying

1:03:11.590,1:03:12.110
it yet."

1:03:12.110,1:03:14.740
You're saying the business case isn't there.
That's what you're saying.

1:03:14.740,1:03:20.280
It's just so darn hard! I mean, a fusion reactor
is a big vacuum tube at 10 keV, which is like

1:03:20.280,1:03:26.510
15 patrillion degrees, and then inside this
are superconducting magnets that are held

1:03:26.510,1:03:31.610
in liquid helium, and all of this is jacketed
in a lithium blanket that will breed megacuries

1:03:31.610,1:03:37.650
of tritium, which will then be injected into
this reactor which is driven by these giant

1:03:37.650,1:03:38.120
neutral-ion beams.

1:03:38.120,1:03:42.530
I mean, it's like, "Oh my gosh! Can we make
this thing any more complicated then it is?"

1:03:42.530,1:03:46.840
And even then you can't hold the confinement
for more than a few microseconds in the Tokamak

1:03:46.840,1:03:49.650
configuration, which is the most favored and
desired.

1:03:49.650,1:03:54.420
Thorium's actually a little bit more down
to earth. If you go to the liquid form, force

1:03:54.420,1:03:59.340
yourself to make that technology commitment,
50 years from now, people will go, "Of course

1:03:59.340,1:04:00.530
that's the answer!"

1:04:00.530,1:04:04.190
Fusion is so hard that we can build a fusion
reactor, and we can have 100 PhDs working

1:04:04.190,1:04:07.680
on it. Fission is so easy that we can take
a couple of kids out of high school, train

1:04:07.680,1:04:09.910
them for a few months, and they can be running
a nuclear submarine.

1:04:09.910,1:04:16.130
Want to build a reactor to bring energy for
the oil sands. This would be the perfect opportunity.

1:04:16.130,1:04:21.630
Well, if we have a reactor like this, do we
need the oil sands?

1:04:21.630,1:04:28.630
I mean, that's the way I look at it; I don't
know a lot about oil sands, but I know that

1:04:28.810,1:04:33.160
it's a particularly hard way to get oil. People
in the middle east can get oil a whole lot

1:04:33.160,1:04:37.570
cheaper from their place then people can get
it from the oil sands. If I can beat them

1:04:37.570,1:04:41.050
by a million to one, maybe we ought to do
that.

1:04:41.050,1:04:46.220
If you were to make the oil sands just a little
tiny bit cleaner, then they would perk up

1:04:46.220,1:04:50.450
their ears, as opposed to clean energy in
and of itself, because it relates to something

1:04:50.450,1:04:50.930
they know.

1:04:50.930,1:04:54.920
I sat on the plane next to a guy who was in
the oil business, and he was telling me all

1:04:54.920,1:04:58.020
about the oil sands, and how much money they're
making and so forth. I was just sort of sitting

1:04:58.020,1:04:59.770
there, taking it in, listening...

1:04:59.770,1:05:02.210
Gas... How much does gas cost here?

1:05:02.210,1:05:04.620
A dollar... A dollar ten?

1:05:04.620,1:05:07.630
Gas costs a dollar ten?

1:05:07.630,1:05:13.210
Yeah, it's expensive, because we have more
tax on gasoline, which I think is a good idea.

1:05:13.210,1:05:14.790
What do you pay for gas?

1:05:14.790,1:05:16.390
I'm paying like, $3.50 for gas.

1:05:16.390,1:05:17.130
Really?

1:05:17.130,1:05:18.550
I thought gas was cheaper in America!

1:05:18.550,1:05:21.020
The Canadian dollar's almost on par, isn't
it?

1:05:21.020,1:05:21.330
Yeah.

1:05:21.330,1:05:24.660
Oh wait... you all do it in liters!

1:05:24.660,1:05:29.970
Do we pump your car with gas and go, "I just
pumped twelve gallons of gas into my car.

1:05:29.970,1:05:34.040
Do you know how much napalm that would make?
If I dropped that on a village, I would kill

1:05:34.040,1:05:38.440
5,000 little children!" You know, and you're
like, "No! Of course not! I'm going to get

1:05:38.440,1:05:42.280
into my car and drive 300 miles on it!" I
mean, it's all about what you do; none of

1:05:42.280,1:05:46.970
this stuff is inherently good or bad, it's
what you decide to do with it.

1:05:46.970,1:05:50.830
You know, one of the things that doesn't earn
me a lot of friends is the notion when we

1:05:50.830,1:05:56.120
talk about, "Oh, so-and-so can't enrich uranium,"
I go, "No offense, but who are we to tell

1:05:56.120,1:06:01.030
anybody what they can do?" I mean, uranium's
uranium, and it's not exactly like we have

1:06:01.030,1:06:02.520
a monopoly on the stuff.

1:06:02.520,1:06:05.630
Same thing goes for things like plutonium.
Plutonium is... I'm not the biggest fan of

1:06:05.630,1:06:10.100
plutonium because I'm not crazy about the
plutonium fast-breeder reactor, but there's

1:06:10.100,1:06:15.420
nothing good or bad about plutonium. Plutonium
just is. It's what you decide to do with it.

1:06:15.420,1:06:18.700
Now, we've made a lot of plutonium in our
reactors. What are we going to do with it?

1:06:18.700,1:06:21.790
Are we going to drop it in a hole in the ground,
or are we going to feed it to a reactor like

1:06:21.790,1:06:25.690
LFTR and make power out of it? I think that's
a whole lot smarter thing to do.

1:06:25.690,1:06:29.130
The other day I was debating some anti-nukes,
and they were getting on LFTR because they

1:06:29.130,1:06:33.820
said, "Oh, this is going to use uranium. You
know, from nuclear weapons!" And I said, "I

1:06:33.820,1:06:38.700
think you guys would be all over that! Take
nuclear weapons, take them apart, take the

1:06:38.700,1:06:41.640
uranium out, burn it up, make electricity!
You want to leave it in the bomb? What do

1:06:41.640,1:06:42.470
you want to do with it?"

1:06:42.470,1:06:47.470
The Navy has as many reactors as we have in
the civilian world. Think about the security

1:06:47.470,1:06:52.630
posture that the US would have if we didn't
have this nuclear capability. Submarines can

1:06:52.630,1:06:57.250
stay underwater and go under the polar ice
cap. If you look the ground forces today,

1:06:57.250,1:07:01.750
we seem to be using a lot of energy, people
wonder if we could cut that down. The energy

1:07:01.750,1:07:03.710
is used for good purposes.

1:07:03.710,1:07:09.370
So, the reason that we can fight in the night,
take out enemies without losing our own soldiers

1:07:09.370,1:07:15.120
is because we have energy powered capabilities.
We have sensors, radios, all sorts of things

1:07:15.120,1:07:18.330
that give us the advantage, and they're all
based on energy. The way that we're sustaining

1:07:18.330,1:07:21.910
the force is we're trucking liquids over the
ground.

1:07:21.910,1:07:26.260
When I was waiting to go into Iraq since we
began invasion in 2003 some of generals couldn't

1:07:26.260,1:07:31.030
get spare parts or supplies out forward because
the convoys were busy carrying fuel and water.

1:07:31.030,1:07:35.270
More significantly, cost in lives, half of
our losses in Iraq are associated with the

1:07:35.270,1:07:36.040
supply chain.

1:07:36.040,1:07:39.480
If we didn't have to carry all that liquid
- 80 percent of the supply chain - we might

1:07:39.480,1:07:43.750
be able to find another way, something called
an adaptive brigade. This force could provide

1:07:43.750,1:07:48.090
its own energy and water and not really have
to be resupplied for say a month at a time.

1:07:48.090,1:07:52.280
If you need energy during the day, put about
a hundred acres of solar panels.

1:07:52.280,1:07:54.940
If you have a threat out there, that might
not work too well because you have to secure

1:07:54.940,1:07:59.240
the whole perimeter and so now all your soldiers
spend their time patrolling the hundred acre

1:07:59.240,1:08:00.210
solar farm.

1:08:00.210,1:08:06.920
What if we had a reactor that was so safe
and simple and economical that you could take

1:08:06.920,1:08:12.060
it out to the battlefield and use it, and
then when you leave, leave it for the host

1:08:12.060,1:08:13.910
nation and they run it.

1:08:13.910,1:08:18.349
Prosperity is related to energy. If we can
bring people to about 2,000 kilowatt hours

1:08:18.349,1:08:24.150
per year of electrical energy, they have a
chance of achieving prosperity. Now, of course,

1:08:24.150,1:08:29.329
prosperity depends upon the rule of law, good
government, property rights, education, but

1:08:29.329,1:08:36.329
electric power for heat, light, transportation,
safety and so on is a critical element of

1:08:37.499,1:08:38.579
prosperity today.

1:08:38.579,1:08:43.449
Developing countries know this. Energy in
coal use is growing rapidly in all the developing

1:08:43.449,1:08:47.679
countries. They want to achieve that level
of prosperity and they're being supported

1:08:47.679,1:08:49.130
by Peabody Coal.

1:08:49.130,1:08:54.679
The National Academy of Sciences said that
every freshwater fish in the United States

1:08:54.679,1:09:00.019
of America now has dangerous levels of mercury
in its flesh. And that mercury is coming from

1:09:00.019,1:09:01.670
coal burning power plants.

1:09:01.670,1:09:06.739
My levels of mercury came back 10 times the
amount of what the EPA considers safe. I was

1:09:06.739,1:09:11.819
told by Dr. David Carpenter, who is the national
authority on mercury toxins, that a woman

1:09:11.819,1:09:15.819
with my levels of mercury in her blood would
have children with cognitive impairment with

1:09:15.819,1:09:16.999
permanent brain damage.

1:09:16.999,1:09:21.119
I said, "Do you mean she might have?" And
he said, "No, no, no. The science is very

1:09:21.119,1:09:26.539
clear right now." Her children would have
some level of permanent neurological impairment,

1:09:26.539,1:09:30.650
probably as a permanent IQ loss in those kids
of five to seven points.

1:09:30.650,1:09:36.559
There are now 640,000 children born in this
country every year who've been exposed to

1:09:36.559,1:09:41.409
dangerous levels of mercury in their mother's
wombs. Ozone and particulates from coal burning

1:09:41.409,1:09:48.409
power plants kill 60,000 Americans a year.
A million asthma attacks, a million lost workdays

1:09:49.639,1:09:51.230
every year.

1:09:51.230,1:09:55.079
That's part of the cost of coal that they
don't tell you about when they say "Oh, it's

1:09:55.079,1:09:57.679
only, you know, ten cents a kilowatt hour."

1:09:57.679,1:10:04.090
Both light water reactors and CANDUs do not
use very much of the energy in the fuel and

1:10:04.090,1:10:08.320
they leave behind two classes of materials.
One is the actual fission products - that's

1:10:08.320,1:10:12.239
what happens when you fission the stuff. Then
there is what's called the transuranics. That's

1:10:12.239,1:10:15.880
what happens when the uranium absorbs the
neutron and doesn't fission, and turns into

1:10:15.880,1:10:19.190
plutonium, americium and curium and few other,
most of it is plutonium.

1:10:19.190,1:10:23.280
The overwhelming majority of transuranics
are plutonium. So when you talk to people

1:10:23.280,1:10:28.530
about waste disposal, they say, "What's the
concern?" Well, most of the stuff that's in

1:10:28.530,1:10:32.900
the fuel is just uranium. It's no more radioactive
than it was when you stuck it in, and it's

1:10:32.900,1:10:35.130
not really a concern.

1:10:35.130,1:10:40.630
And the fission products, they are very radioactive
when they are created, but they decay rather

1:10:40.630,1:10:46.199
quickly. They don't really have long-term
radioactivity. They just decay too fast, it

1:10:46.199,1:10:49.679
is the deal. There are a few of them that
have very long half-lives but that means their

1:10:49.679,1:10:53.110
radioactivity levels are extremely low and
they just don't really pose a hazard.

1:10:53.110,1:10:59.159
The real challenge with spent fuel management
is the presence of those transuranics - plutonium,

1:10:59.159,1:11:03.679
americium, curium - because they have moderate
half-lives and they have complicated decay

1:11:03.679,1:11:06.690
chains. When you're looking at a Yucca mountain
or a disposal site you say, "What are we going

1:11:06.690,1:11:07.219
to do with that?"

1:11:07.219,1:11:13.059
The basic advantage of LFTR over that approach
is we don't form those transuranics. We burn

1:11:13.059,1:11:20.059
up essentially all of the fuel in this process
because we don't remove fuel from the reactor

1:11:20.119,1:11:22.999
until it's a fission product.

1:11:22.999,1:11:27.019
General idea is you don't want uranium, thorium,
or anything else to end up in your waste stream

1:11:27.019,1:11:31.380
and that's a pretty straightforward proposition
in this fluid-fueled reactor. So our waste

1:11:31.380,1:11:37.650
story is a lot different. You can also then
turn around and go back and take some of the

1:11:37.650,1:11:42.840
waste that's already been created in our uranium-fueled
reactors and potentially destroy those long

1:11:42.840,1:11:44.780
lived transuranics through fission.

1:11:44.780,1:11:49.570
Waiting them out to decay is a very slow process.
Plutonium 239, for instance, has a 24,000

1:11:49.570,1:11:52.820
year half-life. That's a long time you're
going to be waiting for that to decay. On

1:11:52.820,1:11:56.530
the other hand, you can fission it and then
those fission products will decay very rapidly

1:11:56.530,1:12:00.230
and you also get an energy release and a neutron
release, both of which are good.

1:12:00.230,1:12:04.190
A thousand kilograms of U-233 is roughly what
we've got. Ninety percent of that'll fission.

1:12:04.190,1:12:09.760
We can make about 500 to $600 million in electricity
and another 50 or $60 million on the fission

1:12:09.760,1:12:15.510
of the uranium-235. Almost all of it will
ultimately end up fissioning. Out of about

1:12:15.510,1:12:20.849
a thousand kilograms, about 15 kilograms of
plutonium-238 will be left over. This is good

1:12:20.849,1:12:27.760
stuff. NASA is desperate for this stuff. Plutonium-238
is different than plutonium-239, the stuff

1:12:27.760,1:12:30.739
we use in bombs. In fact it's worthless for
bombs.

1:12:30.739,1:12:35.219
These radioisotope thermoelectric generators
are based on plutonium-238 and this is the

1:12:35.219,1:12:39.650
only way that we've been able to explore the
outer solar system. The United States is unique.

1:12:39.650,1:12:44.710
It's the only country in the world that has
sent space probes beyond the Asteroid Belt

1:12:44.710,1:12:49.210
and it's all been based on having this technology.
Short answer, we're out of this stuff. It

1:12:49.210,1:12:53.900
's gone. We've used it all up. The Russians
used to sell us some. They've sold us all

1:12:53.900,1:12:55.139
their inventory. It's gone.

1:12:55.139,1:12:59.340
NASA's got billions of dollars of deep space
missions hinging on having enough of this

1:12:59.340,1:13:04.480
stuff to run the batteries to let the thing
call home. We will be able to make this in

1:13:04.480,1:13:08.369
LFTR. If you've heard sometimes about us saying
"We burn up 99 percent of the fuel and there's

1:13:08.369,1:13:14.599
one percent left", the one percent left is
that stuff and it's worth almost as much as

1:13:14.599,1:13:15.670
the stuff we burn up.

1:13:15.670,1:13:18.179
In addition, it would make medical molybdenum-99.

1:13:18.179,1:13:23.360
We are about to shut down the one reactor
in Canada that is making molybdenum-99 for

1:13:23.360,1:13:28.469
medical purposes in 2015. There are hundreds
of thousands of patients that will not be

1:13:28.469,1:13:35.010
able to get their molybdenum-99 that they
need for diagnostic procedures when that happens.

1:13:35.010,1:13:40.179
We can make molybdenum-99 just in normal course
of operation and we can remove it very easily.

1:13:40.179,1:13:46.320
There are four natural decay chains of alpha-emitting
radioisotopes. One starts with U-238, U-235,

1:13:46.320,1:13:53.099
thorium-232, and then there's one that's extinct
because it has no long-lived precursors on

1:13:53.099,1:13:57.550
it. It was there in the supernova billions
of years ago. It's gone now. It's on the U-233

1:13:57.550,1:14:03.079
decay chain. There's a special product on
there, bismuth-213, that could be a smart

1:14:03.079,1:14:07.849
bomb against cancer. They attach the bismuth-213
to an antibody.

1:14:07.849,1:14:12.780
That bismuth only has a half-life of 45 minutes
so it's very radioactive and it's going away

1:14:12.780,1:14:17.980
quickly. But in that time, that antibody can
go and find a cancer cell. The bismuth decays

1:14:17.980,1:14:22.469
and alpha particle goes through the cell,
and it kills the cancer. The radiation technique

1:14:22.469,1:14:27.900
we use in cancer therapy today, they're all
based on beta-emitting isotopes, not on alpha-emitting

1:14:27.900,1:14:34.429
isotopes. They have a big kill radius. They're
not very directable. It's OK, but it's really

1:14:34.429,1:14:35.789
not a smart bomb.

1:14:35.789,1:14:39.920
Alpha-admitting isotopes are really rare.
It's hard to get them. It's hard to get the

1:14:39.920,1:14:44.059
right kind, the right chemical one that will
lock onto the right thing that's close enough

1:14:44.059,1:14:48.249
to being stable that even after it decays,
it doesn't just decay ten more times in the

1:14:48.249,1:14:51.780
body. Bismuth-213 is one decay away from being
done.

1:14:51.780,1:14:57.949
And it's especially good against dispersed
cancers, like leukemia, cancer of the blood.

1:14:57.949,1:15:01.949
Not tumorous cancers, where there's a big
hard lump that you can go in and cut out with

1:15:01.949,1:15:06.639
surgery, but stuff that's hard to get to.
Pancreatic cancer - you get pancreatic cancer,

1:15:06.639,1:15:10.260
you're probably looking at a death sentence,
that's how bad it is.

1:15:10.260,1:15:17.260
Here's the problem, bismuth-213 is unique
in this capability and bismuth-213 can only

1:15:17.730,1:15:19.780
be generated from the decay of Uranium-233.

1:15:19.780,1:15:26.780
I sometimes even lie in bed thinking, if my
kid had leukemia, how hard would I be working

1:15:27.239,1:15:32.510
on getting this therapy ready for them to
save lives and if it's that important, why

1:15:32.510,1:15:34.679
aren't I going full bore on it right now?

1:15:34.679,1:15:36.280
How much did it cost to build?

1:15:36.280,1:15:40.969
What's your ballpark figure? Is this Home
Depot stuff, or...

1:15:40.969,1:15:47.969
No. No, I think a first unit which is probably
going to be on the order of 20/30 megawatts

1:15:48.949,1:15:52.900
electric is - we're looking at several hundred
million dollars to develop that, but then

1:15:52.900,1:15:58.670
taking a step beyond that to utility-class
scale reactor, probably another several hundred

1:15:58.670,1:15:59.369
million dollars.

1:15:59.369,1:16:03.440
You're probably looking at a billion dollars
to bring it up to utility-class, but when

1:16:03.440,1:16:08.550
you consider what it's going to do, that's
really not all that much money. A lot of it

1:16:08.550,1:16:12.719
is the engineering and then the regulation
is a huge question mark.

1:16:12.719,1:16:15.619
It's actually not a lot of money, in a sense.

1:16:15.619,1:16:20.710
I've learned it's not about the number, it's
about the uncertainty on the number. You can

1:16:20.710,1:16:24.460
go to an investment bank right now and you
can say "I want to build and oil drilling

1:16:24.460,1:16:29.449
platform and it's going to cost 12 billion
dollars," and they will write you a check

1:16:29.449,1:16:33.730
for that because you can go and say, "I've
built 50 of these platforms before, here's

1:16:33.730,1:16:37.039
about where the price came out. It's going
to go in this area, which right now is producing

1:16:37.039,1:16:39.949
this much oil, it's going to be out here.
It's going to take this long to recover this

1:16:39.949,1:16:44.489
much oil based on how we've done it the other
50 times." And they go, there's not a lot

1:16:44.489,1:16:46.550
of uncertainty in doing this.

1:16:46.550,1:16:49.260
You start by not making a full LFTR...

1:16:49.260,1:16:49.599
Yes.

1:16:49.599,1:16:53.360
...but making like a little piece. Take some
of these by-products and you use that money

1:16:53.360,1:16:55.920
to get this little first stage that starts
making money...

1:16:55.920,1:16:59.179
Are you sure that we don't have ethernet plugged
into the back of your head somewhere?

1:16:59.179,1:16:59.960
We're doing wireless here. I don't think.

1:16:59.960,1:17:01.010
Could you repeat the question?

1:17:01.010,1:17:01.909
No.

1:17:01.909,1:17:08.909
No. I'm sorry, this question's not covered
by an NDA.

1:17:10.900,1:17:12.269
We got some smart people in this room.

1:17:12.269,1:17:17.420
In aerospace engineering, we were taught to
put development costs and unit costs in the

1:17:17.420,1:17:20.650
separate category. It's like you build a fighter
and you spend billions of dollars to design

1:17:20.650,1:17:25.510
it, but then you run off copies for 20 million
dollars apiece. That's how they build 737s

1:17:25.510,1:17:26.980
or other airplanes.

1:17:26.980,1:17:30.199
If you want to go, "What's the unit cost going
to be?", there's reason to think this is going

1:17:30.199,1:17:35.739
to be a lot less expensive than what we have
today if we set the development in another

1:17:35.739,1:17:35.989
column.

1:17:35.800,1:17:39.329
The reason why, number one, low pressure operation.
That's the biggest one. When you don't have

1:17:39.329,1:17:45.099
to have 96 steel pressure vessels, huge concrete
containments. Number two, you don't have to

1:17:45.099,1:17:48.999
fabricate fuel. You don't have to enrich it.
You don't have to fabricate it and you don't

1:17:48.999,1:17:52.269
have to have the approach to disposal as we
do today.

1:17:52.269,1:17:57.869
Those two features right away are a big deal.
Number three is the safety systems. High pressure,

1:17:57.869,1:18:00.889
water cooler reactors have an abundance of
safety systems designed to always keep the

1:18:00.889,1:18:03.659
core covered with water. So, if one system
has 99 percent reliability; well, you need

1:18:03.659,1:18:08.130
another one that also has it so that you can
get 99.9 and maybe statisticians will get

1:18:08.130,1:18:09.800
mad at me, I might be doing it wrong.

1:18:09.800,1:18:14.369
One of the things that makes the conventional
reactors so expensive the containment vessel

1:18:14.369,1:18:18.969
and you've touched on that. The other is all
the security apparatus around the maintaining

1:18:18.969,1:18:22.929
of the fissile material so that it doesn't
get diverted for military purposes.

1:18:22.929,1:18:27.300
I've scratched my head about that with existing
reactors because our reactors, at least in

1:18:27.300,1:18:29.349
the United States, don't use highly registered
uranium.

1:18:29.349,1:18:33.650
Well, that's one of the fears and that's one
of the security reasons around it. Whether

1:18:33.650,1:18:34.599
it's real or not -

1:18:34.599,1:18:36.989
Yeah, I guess I would have to challenge whether
it's real or not.

1:18:36.989,1:18:40.929
It wasn't that many years ago that we were
able to show parties of visitors around the

1:18:40.929,1:18:45.929
site and actually show them what good condition
the site is in and how safe it is. It's only

1:18:45.929,1:18:51.639
since 9/11 that we've had to stop inviting
visitors. We've always had a very open policy;

1:18:51.639,1:18:55.690
very keen to show people how good we are at
what we do and how safe the plant is. It's

1:18:55.690,1:18:59.940
very difficult to convince yourself that things
are safe because you can't see what's going

1:18:59.940,1:19:00.519
on.

1:19:00.519,1:19:04.130
Even the plutonium inside the reactor is what's
called reactor-grade plutonium, which isn't

1:19:04.130,1:19:04.420
suitable.

1:19:04.420,1:19:08.289
Try going to any facilitate in North America
now, they have SWAT teams and -

1:19:08.289,1:19:12.269
I've toured a nuclear power plant. We've really
got the working when we went in there. I'm

1:19:12.269,1:19:15.869
not exactlysure what the basis of that was,
whether they were worried about theft of fissile

1:19:15.869,1:19:19.920
material - that would be pretty hard. I'd
have to go and depressurize the core, take

1:19:19.920,1:19:24.599
the lid off, get access to all the spent fuel,
somehow remove it from the spent fuel pool

1:19:24.599,1:19:29.429
into some sort of transport cask, take it
off the site to a reprocessing facility that

1:19:29.429,1:19:32.769
doesn't exist and - I mean, I just go "There's
got to be another reason they have all that

1:19:32.769,1:19:33.019
security."

1:19:32.769,1:19:34.010
Watch the TV news.

1:19:34.010,1:19:37.499
Well, you know. It just seems to me, when
there's a subject that I know a little bit

1:19:37.499,1:19:40.489
about and watch how the news covers it, I
get frustrated really quickly.

1:19:40.489,1:19:45.489
I think just about every media outlet I've
seen is drumming up fear. From the New York

1:19:45.489,1:19:47.749
Times to the Huffington Post to the Fox News.

1:19:47.749,1:19:51.079
There's been a recent spike in infant deaths
in Philadelphia and there's one expert right

1:19:51.079,1:19:55.510
now who is saying, "It's radioactive levels
in our water that's to blame for that."

1:19:55.510,1:19:59.510
This has been a very bipartisan approach to
scaring the public.

1:19:59.510,1:20:05.670
Radiation comes across the ocean. It is dissipated
by wind current and salt spray, but it is

1:20:05.670,1:20:08.269
reaching the shore of California.

1:20:08.269,1:20:14.349
There's radiation all over the place, every
single day, but you're talking the damaging

1:20:14.349,1:20:18.900
radiation. That's the thing we're most concerned
about and even in Chernobyl, that didn't get

1:20:18.900,1:20:21.920
to the United States in damaging amounts.
How is it going to do that?

1:20:21.920,1:20:24.570
OK, you know what Bernie. From your mouth,
to God's ears.

1:20:24.570,1:20:29.269
Our media is not built around effectively
and accurately disseminating information to

1:20:29.269,1:20:32.610
the public. Our media is built around...

1:20:32.610,1:20:39.300
Thank you. Our media is built around putting
your eyeballs on their print or on their website

1:20:39.300,1:20:44.929
and keeping them there. The best way to keep
them there is to scare you to death.

1:20:44.929,1:20:51.929
Only 24 hours after the most horrendous tragic,
gargantuan natural disaster of an earthquake

1:20:52.190,1:20:57.249
followed by the tsunami, the only story in
town was about Fukushima.

1:20:57.249,1:21:02.099
As an engineer, we are taught that our responsibility
is to accurately and effectively communicate

1:21:02.099,1:21:06.289
and disseminate information both to other
engineers and to the public at large.

1:21:06.289,1:21:09.670
So an engineer gets on TV and they say, "What's
going to happen, Dr. So-and-So?", and he goes,

1:21:09.670,1:21:13.329
"Well, there's a possibility several things
could happen. A very low probability event

1:21:13.329,1:21:15.960
is that this might happen, but it's much more
likely that --" "Oh, wait. Let's get back

1:21:15.960,1:21:20.010
to that low probability event. Now, in that
low probability event, what could happen?"

1:21:20.010,1:21:23.389
"You know, I guess it's possible that - but
this is really unlikely, and the wind would

1:21:23.389,1:21:27.570
have to blow this way and --" "Well, let's
go that way." The poor engineer, he's thinking

1:21:27.570,1:21:30.369
we're up 10^-12 now, or something like that.

1:21:30.369,1:21:36.249
And they're going, "Does Godzilla form?" "Well,
you know, a double ended DNA break, I suppose

1:21:36.249,1:21:42.030
in the right gene, could actually trigger
an increased growth rate of hormone, which

1:21:42.030,1:21:43.969
could actually lead to mild gigantism."

1:21:43.969,1:21:48.280
They only wanted to know about the risks from
the nuclear incident. And what they particularly

1:21:48.280,1:21:52.719
wanted to know, and asked many times was what
is the worst case scenario.

1:21:52.719,1:21:58.760
Godzilla is coming tomorrow. It's like "Oh
man, we're like 10^-32 at this point. The

1:21:58.760,1:22:02.110
proton is going to decay before this happens."

1:22:02.110,1:22:06.989
You already have a terrible scare story. It
wasn't as if we were asking them to cover

1:22:06.989,1:22:10.550
the good news, not the bad news. There was
plenty of bad news.

1:22:10.550,1:22:14.749
I had a friend of mine. She and her husband
are diplomats in China and she wrote me as

1:22:14.749,1:22:19.210
breathlessly as you can in an email and she
said, "Kirk, are we going to be OK? I'm in

1:22:19.210,1:22:22.199
China, are we going to be all right?" I said,
"Don't worry. The iodine-131 would have to

1:22:22.199,1:22:26.570
blow all the way around the world and then
come back around to get you in China and there

1:22:26.570,1:22:29.039
wouldn't be enough of it, has an eight and
a half day life, so it would have decayed

1:22:29.039,1:22:30.789
to nothing right about here." Blah, blah,
blah.

1:22:30.789,1:22:33.670
But, she was scared to death and this is a
smart girl.

1:22:33.670,1:22:38.719
The Science Media Center's job was to line
up people who know about radiation, who know

1:22:38.719,1:22:43.889
about its affects on humans and without exception,
they said from the beginning, "This is a very,

1:22:43.889,1:22:49.519
very serious incident, but in terms of it
being a threat, even to people in Tokyo, never

1:22:49.519,1:22:55.670
mind to people in Glasgow, they were expressing,
time after time, apart from the people in

1:22:55.670,1:23:01.090
the exclusion zone, that this threat was very,
very, very, very small." And indeed, they

1:23:01.090,1:23:03.469
still feel it is very small.

1:23:03.469,1:23:07.130
Nuclear experts have a vested interest in
playing down nuclear incidents.

1:23:07.130,1:23:12.920
We have journalists coming to us and saying,
"My editor has said to me, what are the apologists

1:23:12.920,1:23:18.050
saying today?" because we were running almost
daily press briefings, with different experts.

1:23:18.050,1:23:22.739
None of them actually worked for industry
as it happened, but yeah, there was this idea,

1:23:22.739,1:23:29.739
that they would say that, wouldn't they? These
leading scientists, who publish and peer-review

1:23:29.869,1:23:36.670
journals, who work for very respected scientific
institutions, are playing down an incident

1:23:36.670,1:23:40.409
because they support the nuclear industry.
That is quite a charge.

1:23:40.409,1:23:47.110
I was just reading an article this morning
saying they detected radioactivity in milk

1:23:47.110,1:23:51.210
and I thought, of course they detected radioactivity
in milk. All milk is radioactive.

1:23:51.210,1:23:57.749
Two of them said, Fiona, our editors think
there is something uniquely terrifying about

1:23:57.749,1:24:04.019
radiation. There is something unique to that
word that has the capacity to really terrify

1:24:04.019,1:24:10.670
people. What a strange set of news values
that what justifies the amount of coverage

1:24:10.670,1:24:13.289
is what your editors feel terrifies people.

1:24:13.289,1:24:17.479
What they really meant to say was there was
a particular radio-isotope they found in the

1:24:17.479,1:24:22.559
milk that came from the Japanese nuclear plant.
The article, of course, didn't mention that,

1:24:22.559,1:24:27.190
which would make people think, "Uh-oh, my
milk has gone from zero radioactivity to some

1:24:27.190,1:24:30.099
radioactivity which must be bad and I must
be in real trouble now."

1:24:30.099,1:24:35.260
The way that this was covered was wrong. I
feel confident in saying that because of how

1:24:35.260,1:24:41.070
many journalists felt uneasy about this. I
know of journalists who were taken off this

1:24:41.070,1:24:45.979
story because what they were writing was too
measured and that's in a really significant,

1:24:45.979,1:24:47.510
major news room in this country.

1:24:47.510,1:24:51.630
In terms of the public's perception of risk,
things that might be true because I read them

1:24:51.630,1:24:56.519
on the Internet, Neil deGrasse Tyson tweeted
today, "the causes of death worldwide in March

1:24:56.519,1:24:59.210
2011, starvation, three million."

1:24:59.210,1:25:03.479
Neil deGrasse Tyson, big fan of his. We've
needed somebody like Neil deGrasse Tyson ever

1:25:03.479,1:25:08.059
since Carl Sagan died. But yeah, what's the
first one on his list, starvation?

1:25:08.059,1:25:13.360
Starvation, 3,000,000; malaria, 250,000; car
crashes, 100,000; quakes and tsunamis 28,000.

1:25:13.360,1:25:17.369
Body count on nuclear power death is what?
Low.

1:25:17.369,1:25:20.889
Civilian nuclear power in the United States
hasn't killed anyone. The body count would

1:25:20.889,1:25:21.420
be zero.

1:25:21.420,1:25:26.639
So when Three Mile Island releases some radiation,
you'd want to incorporate statistic likelihood

1:25:26.639,1:25:29.030
of someone getting thyroid cancer in any number.

1:25:29.030,1:25:33.150
No, because even the statistical likelihood
is theory that is not based on facts. It's

1:25:33.150,1:25:38.159
called the linear no-threshold hypothesis
and it's not based on epidemiological data.

1:25:38.159,1:25:42.729
It's based on the assumption that radiation
will harm you at whatever degree - to whatever

1:25:42.729,1:25:44.289
degree you are exposed.

1:25:44.289,1:25:46.699
I thought that that was established actually.
I thought that...

1:25:46.699,1:25:47.320
No, it's established.

1:25:47.320,1:25:48.309
I've heard that there's...

1:25:48.309,1:25:51.940
It's established policy. That's where that
no such thing as safe radiation - that comes

1:25:51.940,1:25:56.400
from the linear no-threshold hypothesis. It
is established in regulation yet, there's

1:25:56.400,1:26:01.420
no epidemiological data to back that up. There
is no study that says we have taken a cohort

1:26:01.420,1:26:05.269
of people and we have exposed them to one
percent more radiation than normally would

1:26:05.269,1:26:06.920
get and we've seen one percent more cancer.

1:26:06.920,1:26:11.269
In fact, there are many places in the world
where back room levels of radiation are substantially

1:26:11.269,1:26:17.239
higher if the linear no-threshold hypothesis
was in fact true or even approaching truth,

1:26:17.239,1:26:21.719
you would see statistically significantly
higher levels of cancer in those populations,

1:26:21.719,1:26:26.840
those cohorts. But what happens? Not only
is there not higher levels of cancer, there

1:26:26.840,1:26:29.550
are actually suppressed levels of cancer.

1:26:29.550,1:26:34.479
Which leads to a theory that does have substantiation
in the data and that's called hormesis. Hormesis

1:26:34.479,1:26:38.260
is simply a little bit is good for you and
radiation appears to be one of these things

1:26:38.260,1:26:42.999
where a little bit more is actually good for
you and suppresses your development of cancer.

1:26:42.999,1:26:45.969
And I say, well why would a little bit of
radiation be good for me? When you go and

1:26:45.969,1:26:49.369
exercise, you damage your muscles, but your
body rebuilds them and rebuilds them stronger

1:26:49.369,1:26:53.809
than they were before. Radiation stimulates
cellular damage, but it also stimulates the

1:26:53.809,1:26:55.289
body's repair mechanism.

1:26:55.289,1:26:59.420
If hormesis became policy instead of linear
no-threshold, we would have an incredibly

1:26:59.420,1:27:03.989
different approach to radiation. In fact,
in some ways, we actually do accept hormesis

1:27:03.989,1:27:07.469
when it comes to natural radiation, but we
don't accept it when it comes to artificial

1:27:07.469,1:27:09.999
radiation. The reality is, there's no difference
between the two.

1:27:09.999,1:27:14.800
We have a three year environmental assessment
process in Canada to build a nuclear reactor

1:27:14.800,1:27:16.300
and we have a weekend to produce a coal plant.

1:27:16.300,1:27:20.739
Coal and gas plants are able to release radioactive
materials into the environments in much greater

1:27:20.739,1:27:25.559
amounts than a nuclear plant would ever possibly
be allowed to because they are considered

1:27:25.559,1:27:29.489
what's called NORM, Natural Occurring Radioactive
Materials. For instance, when you go frack

1:27:29.489,1:27:34.179
a shale and you pull gas out, a lot of radon
comes out with that too.

1:27:34.179,1:27:39.749
You burn the gas, that radon's being released.
Nobody counts that radon against the gas.

1:27:39.749,1:27:44.539
If they did, the regulatory commission would
shut the gas plant down, same with coal. Coal

1:27:44.539,1:27:47.769
contains small amounts of uranium and thorium.
They go up the stack, they're dispersed.

1:27:47.769,1:27:50.369
That's why they can't tell you how much waste
they produced.

1:27:50.369,1:27:55.130
Yeah, and they spend a lot of money to make
sure that regulatory agencies do not regulate

1:27:55.130,1:28:00.900
NORM for a coal or gas plant the way they
regulate radioactive emissions from a nuclear

1:28:00.900,1:28:06.070
plant. If they did, we would be shutting down
all of our coal and gas plants based on radioactivity

1:28:06.070,1:28:07.479
alone.

1:28:07.479,1:28:10.670
Even if linear no-threshold was actually true
- let's say for a minute it was true, and

1:28:10.670,1:28:15.249
this was the reality of the world. You would
still be much better off establishing an entire

1:28:15.249,1:28:18.739
world powered by nuclear power. The reason
why is because of the radioactive releases

1:28:18.739,1:28:22.440
from coal. You would want to shut down coal
so you could have nuclear, because coal releases

1:28:22.440,1:28:25.679
more radiation than nuclear by several orders
of magnitude.

1:28:25.679,1:28:32.130
The notion that there is no safe amount of
radiation is not a substantiated or even an

1:28:32.130,1:28:38.469
accurate statement. It is probably actually
utterly inaccurate. But, it is commonly found

1:28:38.469,1:28:41.639
as a basis of public policy around the world.

1:28:41.639,1:28:46.800
That was my understanding until just now,
that there was no safe level of radiation.

1:28:46.800,1:28:50.510
Two great books on this- "Terrestrial Energy"
by Bill Tucker, and "The Power to Save the

1:28:50.510,1:28:57.070
World" by Gwen Cravens- go into this topic
extensively. Until this notion of low exposure

1:28:57.070,1:29:03.670
levels of radiation is addressed and put to
bed, it will forever dog the nuclear industry.

1:29:03.670,1:29:07.760
A sunburn is radiation damage. That's radiation
burn. We don't call it that, but that's what

1:29:07.760,1:29:13.499
it is. Your body is responding, trying to
prevent further radiation damage, ionizing

1:29:13.499,1:29:16.780
radiation to your skin and your cells, and
it's generating melanin, which is a natural

1:29:16.780,1:29:18.519
shielding mechanism.

1:29:18.519,1:29:22.229
You don't want to let anybody get too much
radiation dose at any one time and the radioactivity

1:29:22.229,1:29:26.760
that we get from nuclear reactors is extremely
small in comparison to the radioactivity we're

1:29:26.760,1:29:30.659
getting from other sources. The biggest one
being radon. There's a radioactive gas that's

1:29:30.659,1:29:34.760
coming out of the ground all the time. You're
breathing it right now. It is responsible

1:29:34.760,1:29:40.479
by far for the majority of the radioactivity
that your body receives. It's just the planet

1:29:40.479,1:29:41.829
we live on.

1:29:41.829,1:29:45.159
Inside the earth, thorium and uranium are
decaying, and they're decaying very slowly,

1:29:45.159,1:29:50.070
but there's a lot of them and the earth is
big. They produce most of the heat that drives

1:29:50.070,1:29:54.030
the internal processes of the earth. They
produce the heat that drives plate tectonics,

1:29:54.030,1:29:58.510
and they produce the heat that drives the
generation of the magnetic field. If we didn't

1:29:58.510,1:30:02.340
have the energy from thorium, we wouldn't
have carbon recycling in the crust.

1:30:02.340,1:30:07.010
A bigger deal is the magnetic field, because
the magnetic field is deflecting the solar

1:30:07.010,1:30:11.900
wind. If you don't have a magnetic field deflecting
the solar wind, over billions of years your

1:30:11.900,1:30:17.489
planet ends up like Mars. Because the solar
wind will strip off a planet's atmosphere

1:30:17.489,1:30:22.909
without the protecting nature of the magnetic
field. So if we didn't have the energy from

1:30:22.909,1:30:26.340
thorium inside the earth, we would be on a
dead planet.

1:30:26.340,1:30:28.309
A fun thing I tell people, I say, "What's
green energy?" They go, "Geothermal is green

1:30:28.309,1:30:33.340
energy." Do you know where geothermal comes
from? No. It comes from decay of Thorium inside

1:30:33.340,1:30:37.780
the earth. Is geothermal renewable? Yes! OK,
then Thorium is renewable. "No, it's not,

1:30:37.780,1:30:40.550
you're using it up!" Well, you're using up
Thorium as it decays inside the earth, too.

1:30:40.550,1:30:45.929
So any argument for geothermal, if it is rigorously
pursued, is an argument for the renewability

1:30:45.929,1:30:49.739
of thorium as an energy resource. And I love
to have that debate. They usually change the

1:30:49.739,1:30:51.280
rules on me as I get into it.

1:30:51.280,1:30:56.369
But a good one to play on your friends if
they start giving you a hard time for coming

1:30:56.369,1:31:00.829
to protospace and talking about Thorium, you
say, "Dude, it's green energy." "What!?"

1:31:00.829,1:31:05.139
If you're concerned with the environment,
then you want to be aware of what the power

1:31:05.139,1:31:11.139
density of any source is. Anybody who's trying
to sell you biofuels, or this kind of thing,

1:31:11.139,1:31:16.260
what do you do about the thermodynamic inefficiency
of combustion engines? Fuels, that you burn,

1:31:16.260,1:31:22.289
is down in here. Whenever we burn something,
we're using a very inefficient process. Thermodynamics

1:31:22.289,1:31:26.710
typically gives us about 30 percent of the
energy when we burn fuel.

1:31:26.710,1:31:31.369
So every time you put a dollar's worth of
gas in your car, kiss 60 cents goodbye, because

1:31:31.369,1:31:35.639
it's going to go out of the exhaust pipe as
heat. And we waste 10 percent of what's generated

1:31:35.639,1:31:39.699
in transmission lines. So whenever they talk
about these remote solar farms, or remote

1:31:39.699,1:31:43.210
wind farms or anything, you have a debt of
10 percent that you're paying from now on,

1:31:43.210,1:31:45.820
forever. You're never going to get that energy
back.

1:31:45.820,1:31:51.820
Five megawatt, top of the line Siemens wind
mill, takes 10 acres. And five megawatts per

1:31:51.820,1:31:56.389
10 acres, that's half a megawatt per acre.
If you move up to fission, you got hundreds

1:31:56.389,1:32:02.229
of thousands more watts per square foot, per
acre, per pound. Whatever. And if you move

1:32:02.229,1:32:08.519
up to fusion, you get another 10,000 times
that. Fusion we don't have to wait for, because

1:32:08.519,1:32:12.010
fission is good enough for us, particularly
with the thorium cycle.

1:32:12.010,1:32:16.409
A nuclear article would be written. Author
of the article will go to me, or Rod Adams,

1:32:16.409,1:32:20.949
or John Wheeler - somebody who's kind of known
as a public advocate for nuclear. And then

1:32:20.949,1:32:25.389
to go find the other side, Ed Lyman, or Jim
Riccio of Greenpeace, or one of these other

1:32:25.389,1:32:29.110
guys. Now contrast this with an article around
solar, or wind, and I look for this all the

1:32:29.110,1:32:33.389
time. I'm always trying to see, is there another
side in those articles? There's never another

1:32:33.389,1:32:36.979
side. "Such and such a company has announced
they're going to put 50 megawatts of windmills

1:32:36.979,1:32:39.659
in this site. World rejoices."

1:32:39.659,1:32:42.159
And they've chewed up half the mountain to
put the windmills up there.

1:32:42.159,1:32:46.389
They get more subsidies per megawatt hour
than any other form of energy by one or two

1:32:46.389,1:32:51.949
orders of magnitude. I mean, it is huge! We're
offering to buy back solar energy from people

1:32:51.949,1:32:57.400
who produce it at 35 to 50 cents a kilowatt
hour. I mean, that's obscene. Why on Earth,

1:32:57.400,1:33:00.960
if you're making energy at your home, you
should sell it back to the grid at whatever

1:33:00.960,1:33:05.260
the grid is buying at that time. The grid
should not have to buy energy from you at

1:33:05.260,1:33:06.989
some massively increased price.

1:33:06.989,1:33:09.400
But they're subsidizing technology until it
gets more efficient.

1:33:09.400,1:33:12.409
When all of these tariffs are reduced, the
things that we're supposed to encourage, and

1:33:12.409,1:33:17.179
jump start an industry, the industry collapses.
Solar industry in Germany and in Spain is

1:33:17.179,1:33:21.739
in utter collapse because of the projected
removal of fees and tariffs because these

1:33:21.739,1:33:26.300
are simply not economical sources of energy.
The subsidy may be well intentioned to try

1:33:26.300,1:33:30.260
to get the industry to get going on its own
but that's usually not the way things work.

1:33:30.260,1:33:34.539
Every energy source is subsidized, right?
If oil is subsidized because we're sending

1:33:34.539,1:33:35.869
people off to war...

1:33:35.869,1:33:41.059
The levels of the subsidies are substantially
lower for established industries than they

1:33:41.059,1:33:42.909
are for things like solar and wind.

1:33:42.909,1:33:46.769
George Monbiot, who writes in The Guardian,
he has recently come out very strongly in

1:33:46.769,1:33:50.280
support of nuclear power because of what happened
at Fukushima Daiichi, how if survived the

1:33:50.280,1:33:54.510
earthquake and the overall effect has been
nothing compared to the death and loss of

1:33:54.510,1:33:55.559
life from the tsunami.

1:33:55.559,1:33:59.199
Well, he mentioned in an article that he wrote
yesterday that he talked to Caroline Lucas,

1:33:59.199,1:34:04.300
the head of the green party in the U.K. And
he asked her why she would support subsidies

1:34:04.300,1:34:07.579
on solar and wind. She goes "I oppose subsides
for nuclear but I support them for solar and

1:34:07.579,1:34:11.340
wind because nuclear is an established industry
and solar and wind are still developing industries,

1:34:11.340,1:34:15.960
and they need public support in order to flourish."
And so George, a very smart guy, said "Will

1:34:15.960,1:34:20.889
you support research into thorium reactors,
which could provide a much safer and cheaper

1:34:20.889,1:34:23.670
means of producing nuclear power?"

1:34:23.670,1:34:28.460
No, because thorium reactors are not a proven
technology.

1:34:28.460,1:34:32.749
On an individual level we are seeing a lot
of people change their minds. But at the organizational

1:34:32.749,1:34:38.030
level we're not seeing any change. The people
who run the environmentalist organizations,

1:34:38.030,1:34:38.280
and that's unfortunate.

1:34:38.130,1:34:43.209
Have you had a one-on-one where you are talking
to someone and they get this?

1:34:43.209,1:34:47.300
It's tough for people who are further up the
food chain in these organizations to come

1:34:47.300,1:34:51.959
out and make public policy statements. A lot
of people get it one-on-one but they're afraid

1:34:51.959,1:34:56.920
to be the first one to stand up and say "Ra-ra-ra,
let's go do this." It's a lot easier when

1:34:56.920,1:34:58.789
you feel like everybody else is behind you.

1:34:58.789,1:35:04.249
Why are appeals to technological advancements
always made with regards to solar and wind?

1:35:04.249,1:35:07.159
It's going to get better it's going to get
cheaper, it's going to get more efficient.

1:35:07.159,1:35:10.719
Don't worry about what we have now, cause
it's going to be better next year. But yet

1:35:10.719,1:35:14.869
nuclear is assigned this position back in
the '50s where it can never get better, it

1:35:14.869,1:35:19.289
can never incorporate a new technology, it
can never improve and we won't even entertain

1:35:19.289,1:35:20.840
if it does get any better.

1:35:20.840,1:35:25.719
Nuclear right now means water cooled reactor,
uranium oxide solid fuel, poor fuel efficiency

1:35:25.719,1:35:31.510
and steam turbine. That's what nuclear power
means right now. So people look at Fukushima

1:35:31.510,1:35:37.789
Daiichi and they go, "Is this the end of nuclear
power?" and I go, "No, it's not the end of

1:35:37.789,1:35:39.300
nuclear power, there's a zillion other ways
to do nuclear power."

1:35:39.300,1:35:44.190
The reactor that we worked on is cooled by
a liquid salt, a nuclear fuel in the form

1:35:44.190,1:35:45.429
of solid pebbles.

1:35:45.429,1:35:50.739
They're cooled by fluoride salts, but the
fuel is not dissolved in the salts, it's in

1:35:50.739,1:35:51.809
a solid form.

1:35:51.809,1:35:56.690
I was invited to the director's office. The
physicist there telling me, "What you have

1:35:56.690,1:36:02.579
invented is a new thorium uranium-233 breeder."
Have you ever heard of about EXYDER, of course

1:36:02.579,1:36:02.969
not.

1:36:02.969,1:36:07.659
Just imagine what would happen if there was
a light water reactor where the nuclear steam

1:36:07.659,1:36:14.449
supply system was in a single vessel, no piping
penetrations in excess of about three inches

1:36:14.449,1:36:17.570
in diameter. I'm working on that exact reactor.

1:36:17.570,1:36:22.829
From their reaction to Fukushima, it was an
indication that people didn't understand the

1:36:22.829,1:36:29.780
options around nuclear. Updating the old infrastructure
will increase the safety standards significantly.

1:36:29.780,1:36:36.159
Generation two and three are still operational,
generation 3.5 is what's being built right

1:36:36.159,1:36:40.869
now and generation four has higher safety
standards, easier to build and so cheaper

1:36:40.869,1:36:46.150
to build better fuel utilization, drastically
cheaper energy, even safer reactors.

1:36:46.150,1:36:50.570
Maybe there's a better way, if you can figure
out how to do this better, I will be happy

1:36:50.570,1:36:54.209
to get off LFTR and go do whatever that is
better. This is the best way I've be able

1:36:54.209,1:36:55.499
to come up with so far.

1:36:55.499,1:36:57.449
Can you do a recap on what the study said?

1:36:57.449,1:37:01.190
The title of the study was "Thorium was no
panacea for nuclear energy." They were trying

1:37:01.190,1:37:03.190
to point out the deficiencies in thorium.

1:37:03.190,1:37:09.829
I didn't think they were applying a very fair
logic to it because they would say "Thorium

1:37:09.829,1:37:14.070
in a solid fuel reactor would do blah blah
blah. See that's not very good so thorium's

1:37:14.070,1:37:14.320
dumb."

1:37:14.119,1:37:17.820
Well no, thorium's dumb in a solid fuel reactor.
Not "thorium's dumb."

1:37:17.820,1:37:23.579
If you're going go out there try to put something
out to the public saying "I'm going to authoritatively

1:37:23.579,1:37:28.440
refute the use of thorium as an energy source,"
then it behooves you to do your homework.

1:37:28.440,1:37:30.880
Is it safe as it sounds what's preventing
North American governments from actually creating

1:37:30.880,1:37:37.880
the reactor? What's the scary thing about
it?

1:37:38.579,1:37:43.050
Ah, you're thinking like me 10 years ago,
you're looking for a reason why not, I don't

1:37:43.050,1:37:46.989
think there is a reason why not. There may
be a reason why they may not be excited to

1:37:46.989,1:37:47.590
do it.

1:37:47.590,1:37:49.360
But there's no reason why they can't do it.

1:37:49.360,1:37:55.659
If I'm a company that's building CANDUs or
light-water reactors, what competitive advantage

1:37:55.659,1:37:59.900
do I have by pursuing this other direction?
Probably don't have any.

1:37:59.900,1:38:03.570
There's such a thing as nuclear hacking, it's
what this whole thing is about, because we're

1:38:03.570,1:38:09.429
not talking about nuclear technology the way
it's done now, we're talking about a completely

1:38:09.429,1:38:11.690
different approach to nuclear energy.

1:38:11.690,1:38:15.940
So maybe we'll look back in the future and
it's meetings and gatherings like this we'll

1:38:15.940,1:38:19.449
go "Man, that was where it got started. It
didn't get started at Westinghouse or Atomic

1:38:19.449,1:38:24.909
Energy of Canada, or GE," there's a ton we
could do in this reactor that would even involve

1:38:24.909,1:38:29.400
the radioactive materials. All the stuff like
the power conversion system all the chemistry,

1:38:29.400,1:38:31.309
that could all be done non-nuclear.

1:38:31.309,1:38:37.249
I don't have a lot of faith that the current
nuclear institutions, to be honest, what exactly

1:38:37.249,1:38:41.289
do we want from them? I mean all of their
technology is based around technology that

1:38:41.289,1:38:43.039
isn't what's going to go into this machine.

1:38:43.039,1:38:47.739
We want the fact they have the ear of governments
and very large banks.

1:38:47.739,1:38:51.829
OK, how many- we're not exactly building lots
of nuclear reactors right now. All their money

1:38:51.829,1:38:56.690
now is coming off fuel supply contracts. That's
how GE and Westinghouse make money on nuclear

1:38:56.690,1:39:01.329
power today, they don't build reactors, they
sell fuel. Now 30 years ago they were building

1:39:01.329,1:39:04.889
reactors, but that's not really going on right
now.

1:39:04.889,1:39:10.030
So their business model is overwhelmingly
dominated by fuel fabrications. Come on now

1:39:10.030,1:39:14.539
you say, "Guess what I got a reactor it's
got no fuel fabrication to it," you just upended

1:39:14.539,1:39:15.260
their business model.

1:39:15.260,1:39:19.489
In the United States we're building two reactors
right now. We're going to shut down more reactors

1:39:19.489,1:39:24.590
than that in a few years. We're not getting
ahead of anything, we'll be lucky to hold

1:39:24.590,1:39:27.329
the line. I don't even think we're going to
be able to do that.

1:39:27.329,1:39:29.880
What about in developing countries like China
and India?

1:39:29.880,1:39:33.690
China's ripping it up, China's building like
50 reactors right now.

1:39:33.690,1:39:39.170
But even China's realized, "We can't built
reactors based around water cooling and uranium

1:39:39.170,1:39:43.889
oxide fuel, it's not going last that long."
China's doing LFTR, even as we speak.

1:39:43.889,1:39:45.709
I found that ago a few months ago.

1:39:45.709,1:39:48.579
Where are they getting the blueprints? Or
are they developing them?

1:39:48.579,1:39:55.300
Well, I mean they've probably got a whole
bunch of stuff from the PDFs on my website.

1:39:55.300,1:40:00.670
It's been in the public domain for an awful
long time. I just made it a little easier

1:40:00.670,1:40:01.699
to get.

1:40:01.699,1:40:05.670
This was about 10 years ago. I got in the
car, I lived in Alabama and I was able to

1:40:05.670,1:40:08.909
go up to Oak Ridge then talk to some of the
people there. And I said "Hey, I've heard

1:40:08.909,1:40:13.909
that you guys long time ago did this really,
really cool thing. What's going on?" and they're

1:40:13.909,1:40:17.360
like "Yeah, long time ago we did a really,
really cool thing and everybody that did it

1:40:17.360,1:40:18.320
is either retired or dead now."

1:40:18.320,1:40:22.199
I'm like "Oh, well, that's not good. What
can we do?" and they said "Well, they wrote

1:40:22.199,1:40:27.119
a lot of papers and they wrote a lot of reports."
I said "Oh, OK. Can I get them?" "Oh yeah"

1:40:27.119,1:40:31.729
then they took me to this file cabinet and
it was like full of stuff. And PDF'd - not

1:40:31.729,1:40:33.889
everything but most of it, about two-thirds
of it.

1:40:33.889,1:40:40.030
So, I had this stack of CD's and I thought
"Oh!" Send a copy to the Secretary of Energy,

1:40:40.030,1:40:44.530
send a copy to the Director of National Labs,
send it all out to these different places

1:40:44.530,1:40:50.409
just sure they were going to get CDs from
a random person and put them in their computer

1:40:50.409,1:40:55.179
and study them extensively - all five Gigabytes
of them - and come to the same conclusion

1:40:55.179,1:41:00.650
I had and change national policy. I mean,
of course, right? If we do not get this message

1:41:00.650,1:41:04.869
out to everyone, then nothing's going to change.

1:41:04.869,1:41:10.039
In early 2010 EFT bloggers noticed that all
these guys who were trying signing up from

1:41:10.039,1:41:13.769
Shanghai, Beijing and they started asking
questions about this and that.

1:41:13.769,1:41:17.780
They went to Oak Ridge. They took them around
the lab and showed them everything. And it's

1:41:17.780,1:41:21.619
funny going to Oak Ridge because they're all
about the info and the nano and the bio and

1:41:21.619,1:41:25.139
you want to go, "What about the nuclear?"
They never talk about that part. Well, we

1:41:25.139,1:41:29.420
get to the end of the trip and the Chinese
official's name was Dr. Jiang Mianheng...

1:41:29.420,1:41:32.979
interesting about Dr. Jiang Mianheng, his
father was Jiang Zemin, who used to be the

1:41:32.979,1:41:38.300
premier of China. So, this is not a poorly-placed
guy in Chinese society.

1:41:38.300,1:41:40.280
Trained in the United States in Pennsylvania.

1:41:40.280,1:41:43.989
PhD in Electrical Engineer from Drexel University;
very, very bright guy.

1:41:43.989,1:41:46.289
They were under a non-disclosure agreement
between RGOE and the Chinese government.

1:41:46.289,1:41:49.579
So they get to the end of the meeting and
I'm told by Oak Ridge people "You know we

1:41:49.579,1:41:54.249
had this great trip. Have you learned what
you wanted to learn?" and they go "We're actually

1:41:54.249,1:41:58.139
here to learn about the molten salt reactor.
You see, we're going to build one - we've

1:41:58.139,1:42:01.070
already got a site picked out - and we're
going to have it built by 2020 and we're here

1:42:01.070,1:42:06.340
to learn everything we can about it." And
in Oak Ridge we were like "Huh..."

1:42:06.340,1:42:09.559
Anybody have their earphones in their ears
while I've been talking to try and drown me

1:42:09.559,1:42:14.639
out? Older folks like me will recall a day
when earphones didn't look like that. The

1:42:14.639,1:42:19.459
whole trick has been the invention of a little
magnet based on neodymium, neodymium-iron-boron

1:42:19.459,1:42:23.590
magnets. Extremely powerful magnets, and they
use a rare earth mineral called neodymium.

1:42:23.590,1:42:29.440
And because neodymium-iron-boron magnets are
so powerful one of the places they find application

1:42:29.440,1:42:32.909
is in the generators that sit on top of windmills.

1:42:32.909,1:42:37.869
Global demand for wind has really increased
desire to find neodymium.

1:42:37.869,1:42:41.780
Currently it's all being mined in China. Now
why am I talking about neodymium?

1:42:41.780,1:42:46.309
Well, because thorium is always found with
heavy rare earth elements. If you remember

1:42:46.309,1:42:49.519
your periodic table, the lanthanides that
column above the actinides, those are all

1:42:49.519,1:42:50.539
the rare earths.

1:42:50.539,1:42:56.389
Thorium policy in all western nations undermines
the successful development of a domestic rare

1:42:56.389,1:43:00.039
earth market. All of the rare earths that
most western mining companies are willing

1:43:00.039,1:43:05.510
to process are what they call bastnasites
or carbonatites. They typically select these

1:43:05.510,1:43:10.989
rare earths not because of the high ratios
of rare earths but simply the absence of thorium.

1:43:10.989,1:43:16.599
So consequently the only operating rare earth
mine that just opened up this year, according

1:43:16.599,1:43:22.599
to their own filings in the USGS, produces
essentially the lighter half of the lanthanide

1:43:22.599,1:43:28.449
scale and in fact does have some monazites,
which are a thorium rare earth enriched mineralization,

1:43:28.449,1:43:29.719
which they dispose of.

1:43:29.719,1:43:35.329
So what happens all across America, Canada,
and South America, there are beautiful monazite

1:43:35.329,1:43:39.849
deposits that have heavy rare earths which
could be very commercial except for the thorium

1:43:39.849,1:43:40.209
content.

1:43:40.209,1:43:45.809
Mountain Pass was originally closed, according
to CEO Mark Smith, because of the EPA and

1:43:45.809,1:43:50.530
the state of California and some thorium that
came out of a ruptured tailing site. Thorium

1:43:50.530,1:43:56.920
represents this unknown and unlimited liability
to rare earth production, so it plays into

1:43:56.920,1:43:58.150
the hands of China.

1:43:58.150,1:44:03.380
First, China provided rare earth elements
very cheaply to everybody in the world by

1:44:03.380,1:44:08.809
their cheap labor, lack of enforceable environmental
regulations, and their appreciate currency.

1:44:08.809,1:44:12.559
Essentially, consolidate and control the rare
earth market.

1:44:12.559,1:44:17.559
And then they said, "Well, now all of you
are coming to our door to buy our rare earths.

1:44:17.559,1:44:22.209
We don't want to sell the raw material anymore.
Our manufacturers can buy it cheaper."

1:44:22.209,1:44:28.909
They impose a huge export tax on rare earth
elements. So, one had a choice to accept a

1:44:28.909,1:44:35.300
huge tax and an increase in the price of the
product or relocate factory into mainland

1:44:35.300,1:44:40.440
China and buy rare earth elements on the local
market without tax.

1:44:40.440,1:44:43.619
It's a strategy and it's working pretty well.

1:44:43.619,1:44:47.949
Manufacturers which use rare earth elements
in their products relocated their manufacturing

1:44:47.949,1:44:53.349
base inside China. The jobs in manufacturing
transferred from the United States and western

1:44:53.349,1:44:55.489
Europe into the Chinese mainland.

1:44:55.489,1:45:00.440
They've moved all the way up the value chain
and are actually able to leverage their position

1:45:00.440,1:45:06.849
into capturing other countries I.P. If Toyota
really wants to build a million battery packs,

1:45:06.849,1:45:11.369
in the end, if they don't find a solution
to the heavy rare earth problem, they'll be

1:45:11.369,1:45:12.380
building them inside China.

1:45:12.380,1:45:18.840
So what we need to be able to do is let another
entity take that thorium, develop uses and

1:45:18.840,1:45:20.309
markets, including energy.

1:45:20.309,1:45:24.519
So, let's say, for example, you've got a single
rare earth refinery creating about 20,000

1:45:24.519,1:45:29.300
tons of heavy rare earths a year. On current
consumption, that's about 130 percent of domestic

1:45:29.300,1:45:34.400
consumption for rare earths. That automatically
undermines China's advantage. Now, there's

1:45:34.400,1:45:38.829
two places on the planet Earth where you have
a guaranteed supply of heavy rare earths.

1:45:38.829,1:45:43.849
What can your country leverage that into?
This is the fulcrum you need to get back into

1:45:43.849,1:45:46.099
the world economy as a manufacturer.

1:45:46.099,1:45:50.749
Since 99 percent of the rare earths that we
use, including those magnets? Well, when those

1:45:50.749,1:45:53.709
got mined, there was probably some thorium
that came up with it that's probably sitting

1:45:53.709,1:46:00.709
in some barrels over in China right now, waiting
for Dr. Jhang to finish his experiments with

1:46:00.900,1:46:03.829
thorium molten salt reactors and to start
putting them to use.

1:46:03.829,1:46:07.999
This is the most important thing that's going
to happen in the next 24 months, and whoever

1:46:07.999,1:46:13.309
gets that is essentially going to control
the destiny and the roll out of energy for

1:46:13.309,1:46:14.539
the foreseeable future.

1:46:14.539,1:46:19.119
They need to be able to realize the promise
of thorium. But, I'd also like to see us succeed,

1:46:19.119,1:46:24.199
you know? We were working on this stuff a
long time ago, we made great progress on it.

1:46:24.199,1:46:29.659
We set it down in 1974 for kind of dumb reasons,
and I think it's high time that we picked

1:46:29.659,1:46:31.789
that thread back up again.

1:46:31.789,1:46:36.479
Energy seems to correlate with influence.
People who have energy, which used to be the

1:46:36.479,1:46:41.329
U.S., we had a lot of influence, now, there
are others who have a lot of energy, and they

1:46:41.329,1:46:42.639
seem to be gaining influence.

1:46:42.639,1:46:47.579
The real question is whether the U.S. is missing
a strategic national security opportunity.

1:46:47.579,1:46:52.039
We can either be on the wagon or we can buy
foreign reactors in the future.

1:46:52.039,1:46:56.979
The worldwide energy business is about a three
trillion dollar a year business. And an awful

1:46:56.979,1:47:03.979
lot of folks' wealth and power rides on the
business of moving large amounts of hydro-carbon

1:47:04.019,1:47:06.059
from one place to another.

1:47:06.059,1:47:12.070
You're on a billion, million dollar idea here.
And to switch over from fuels like oil, gas,

1:47:12.070,1:47:17.940
uranium, do you worry that might be a possible
problem?

1:47:17.940,1:47:24.400
I'm a lot more worried about someday looking
at our descendants and have them say, "Why

1:47:24.400,1:47:28.570
did you give us this world that we have now?
Why did you give us this world of energy poverty,

1:47:28.570,1:47:34.389
of pollution, of war, of disease, when you
knew there was a better way and you could

1:47:34.389,1:47:37.260
have made it happen? Why didn't you do it?"

1:47:37.260,1:47:41.059
That's the same question we'd ask these guys
if we could go back to 1969, right? "Why didn't

1:47:41.059,1:47:45.300
you do this? You knew about it, you could
have made it happen, but you didn't. What's

1:47:45.300,1:47:46.420
your excuse?"

1:47:46.420,1:47:50.690
Human beings have been superstitious and fearful
for most of their history. An era of enlightenment

1:47:50.690,1:47:55.380
has been a relatively short space of human
history, and by no means assured that it will

1:47:55.380,1:47:56.789
continue in that manner.

1:47:56.789,1:48:02.079
I really believe that if we don't have access
to affordable and clean energy, we will revert.

1:48:02.079,1:48:05.130
We will go back to the way humans had been
for thousands and thousands of years, which

1:48:05.130,1:48:10.510
is where the powerful and the rich oppress
the masses, who lived terrible lives trying

1:48:10.510,1:48:13.260
to provide things for just a few people.

1:48:13.260,1:48:19.639
We will literally not only revert to barbarism
but revert to social institutions like slavery.

1:48:19.639,1:48:21.369
And I mean that with all seriousness.

1:48:21.369,1:48:24.349
You only have a limited amount of money, you
want to reduce greenhouse gases, so you want

1:48:24.349,1:48:29.059
to apply the dollars in ways that reduce greenhouse
gases the most while creating the most employment

1:48:29.059,1:48:30.519
possible for that investment.

1:48:30.519,1:48:35.380
But, all the jobs that they create have to
be built into the price of the power they

1:48:35.380,1:48:38.699
provide. Yeah, it would provide a lot of jobs
but it's at the expense of the people that

1:48:38.699,1:48:39.860
use the energy.

1:48:39.860,1:48:44.860
If we can provide an energy source cheaper
than from coal, all the nations, in their

1:48:44.860,1:48:49.260
own economic self-interest, will choose it
over coal.

1:48:49.260,1:48:51.349
Nuclear energy is not terribly reliable.

1:48:51.349,1:48:55.550
It's a turbine that we just take from a gas
plant and suspend it from a big scaffolding,

1:48:55.550,1:49:01.320
a tower, and surround it by giant mirrors
in the desert. If a cloud passes over, or

1:49:01.320,1:49:06.340
during the evening, the utility wants a base
load. And the way that we're going to deliver

1:49:06.340,1:49:10.940
that base load is by powering it with gas.
We're building these all over the country,

1:49:10.940,1:49:16.309
and one of the questions we ask, we need about
3,000 foot in altitude. We need flat land,

1:49:16.309,1:49:20.949
we need 300 days of sunlight, and we need
to be near a gas pipe.

1:49:20.949,1:49:22.439
Hugely expensive capital costs.

1:49:22.439,1:49:26.979
Here are four independent proposals to build
molten salt reactors and their dates. The

1:49:26.979,1:49:28.559
median is $1.98.

1:49:28.559,1:49:34.079
You look at a LFTR for one to two dollars
a watt, you're looking at a full cost there,

1:49:34.079,1:49:38.739
because the fuel cost is so close to zero
that you can safely ignore it.

1:49:38.739,1:49:40.670
Nuclear energy only produces electricity.

1:49:40.670,1:49:45.610
Now all our reactors today use steam turbines.
Now we don't use that because we're stupid,

1:49:45.610,1:49:51.010
we use it because the limitations of pressurized
water mean that you can't get it all that

1:49:51.010,1:49:53.150
hot. I mean, the reactor just doesn't get
that hot.

1:49:53.150,1:49:58.219
With this reactor, we can get up to more like
700 or 800C, and at those temperatures, the

1:49:58.219,1:50:02.420
gas turbine turns out to be a better fit.
So you can generate electricity from the gas

1:50:02.420,1:50:06.469
turbine, and you've got to cool the gas, and
every thermodynamic cycle has to reject waste

1:50:06.469,1:50:07.090
heat.

1:50:07.090,1:50:10.630
Almost no economic penalty to desalinate sea
water.

1:50:10.630,1:50:15.670
Or we might try to synthesize fuel. We can
configure it, not to produce electricity,

1:50:15.670,1:50:20.570
but to dissociate water. You can make ammonia
out of hydrogen, which could be a fuel. It's

1:50:20.570,1:50:25.170
also a fertilizer. Ammonia production consumes
more than one percent of the entire world

1:50:25.170,1:50:26.610
energy budget today.

1:50:26.610,1:50:30.229
It's about 14 years from when you put the
project forward to when it's built, and it's

1:50:30.229,1:50:31.849
famous for cost overruns.

1:50:31.849,1:50:37.959
We used to build small reactors in a short
period of time. May of 1961, Congress funded

1:50:37.959,1:50:39.550
Camp Century in Greenland.

1:50:39.550,1:50:44.610
The assembly is still subcritical. We began
to transfer the fuel elements one by one,

1:50:44.610,1:50:46.559
and started loading the reactor core.

1:50:46.559,1:50:50.489
The reactor was operating under the ice 18
months later.

1:50:50.489,1:50:56.039
The Brayton cycle uses an inert gas, so you
don't have to worry about fuel explosions,

1:50:56.039,1:51:00.599
you get more efficiency out of the turbine
side, and the turbines are smaller and cheaper

1:51:00.599,1:51:01.400
to build.

1:51:01.400,1:51:02.400
The risk of accidents

1:51:02.400,1:51:07.110
We can achieve safety for less cost because
we're moving to passive safety rather than

1:51:07.110,1:51:11.709
engineered safety. We see this trend with
reactors like AP1000 but the LFTR can take

1:51:11.709,1:51:13.780
it to a much higher level.

1:51:13.780,1:51:18.400
Commercial nuclear energy around the world
has a very good safety record even if you

1:51:18.400,1:51:23.219
include Chernobyl. The number of deaths from
nuclear power plant accidents is less than

1:51:23.219,1:51:25.780
a hundred around the world, ever.

1:51:25.780,1:51:30.739
Just last year we had a natural gas explosion
at a clean energy facility in Middletown,

1:51:30.739,1:51:35.110
CT that killed seven people, a coal dust and
methane explosion at the Upper Big Branch

1:51:35.110,1:51:40.239
coal mine which killed 29 people, and a methane
explosion in Deepwater Horizon that killed

1:51:40.239,1:51:45.679
11 people. San Bruno fire, which was a natural
gas pipeline running underneath a neighborhood

1:51:45.679,1:51:49.320
and it blew up and killed about eight people
and destroyed 50 homes.

1:51:49.320,1:51:53.900
Why do you pick nuclear power to pick on?
Why don't you pick on gas transmission? Why

1:51:53.900,1:51:57.469
don't you pick on all these other sources
of actual deaths?

1:51:57.469,1:52:01.320
Long lived nuclear waste that has to be kept
out of the biosphere for over a quarter of

1:52:01.320,1:52:01.959
a million years.

1:52:01.959,1:52:06.199
Really most of that waste is unburned fuel.
There are ways to reprocess it and burn more,

1:52:06.199,1:52:10.860
but it's quite expensive and it's not economically
advantageous in today's reactors. The breakthrough

1:52:10.860,1:52:16.939
in going to fluid fuels means you don't have
to reprocess or recycle, you leave the nuclear

1:52:16.939,1:52:18.630
fuel in the reactor until it's burned up.

1:52:18.630,1:52:22.670
They remain in the salt and they decay in
the salt until they give off all their decay

1:52:22.670,1:52:23.499
heat.

1:52:23.499,1:52:30.499
Here's our transuranics - these figures show
10^-7, 10^-4, 10^-7, 10^-9 grams, this is

1:52:33.479,1:52:38.900
teeny teeny production. A thousandths of a
gram of these dreaded materials in 10 years

1:52:38.900,1:52:43.989
of operation. This is good. Waste profile,
much healthier.

1:52:43.989,1:52:45.639
The risk of nuclear proliferation

1:52:45.639,1:52:51.849
The proliferation hardening on this one, U-232,
we've got protactinium. It sends out a bright

1:52:51.849,1:52:57.869
gamma cascade, so if somebody tries to run
off with it we can catch them pretty easily.

1:52:57.869,1:53:01.630
You don't even have to look at those issues
for nuclear to fail.

1:53:01.630,1:53:06.719
The petrochemical industry, the hydrocarbon
industry spends a lot of money advertising.

1:53:06.719,1:53:13.070
They believe in wind and the sun. Exxon is
talking about growing algae, all kinds of

1:53:13.070,1:53:18.150
alternatives. You'll never hear a hydrocarbon
company talking about nuclear.

1:53:18.150,1:53:25.150
You'll see an awful lot of stories of somebody
in the gas or oil industry working against

1:53:25.179,1:53:30.900
nuclear and trying to raise the barriers of
entry. That's a simulated nuclear fuel pellet.

1:53:30.900,1:53:37.900
It's as much energy as a ton of coal, 147
gallons of oil, or 17,000 cubic feet of natural

1:53:38.219,1:53:39.389
gas.

1:53:39.389,1:53:44.479
If you're making money selling hydrocarbons,
you're going to make less money.

1:53:44.479,1:53:50.340
I was born the year they canceled this research
in Tennessee. I feel like all I've done with

1:53:50.340,1:53:55.469
the blog, is I've stood up and said, "Here's
this amazing work that was done before I was

1:53:55.469,1:53:56.380
even born."

1:53:56.380,1:54:01.079
This is laws of physics stuff. I didn't invent
it, all I do promote it. Maybe I'll never

1:54:01.079,1:54:04.570
see it happen in my life, but somebody will
do it. Once people have learned how to do

1:54:04.570,1:54:07.499
it, they'll keep using it, because it will
make that much of difference.

1:54:07.499,1:54:10.610
Other people who are a whole lot smarter than
me have looked at it and said, "This looks

1:54:10.610,1:54:12.630
darn pretty good, why aren't we doing this?"

1:54:12.630,1:54:14.420
How long do you think it's going to take?

1:54:14.420,1:54:18.019
At the rate we're going now in the United
States it'll never happen. But, that's going

1:54:18.019,1:54:18.280
to change.

1:54:18.280,1:54:22.170
We're going to make it happen. I think in
10 years we will be building LFTRs in factory

1:54:22.170,1:54:23.139
assembly lines.

1:54:23.139,1:54:26.969
We can be competitive with China on making
patents on things that weren't thought of

1:54:26.969,1:54:32.719
in the 50's and 60's. But, if we wait, Americans,
Canadians, and Brazilians will be buying LFTR

1:54:32.719,1:54:35.559
and molten salt technology from China and
paying them the royalties.

1:54:35.559,1:54:40.039
We buy a lot of things from China already.
It's not as if we're not buying enough things

1:54:40.039,1:54:46.860
from China. We are definitely keeping them
busy. Let's go develop thorium. That's really

1:54:46.860,1:54:48.559
what I'd like to do.

1:54:48.559,1:54:53.389
If everyone in the world has a lifestyle like
you and I can enjoy in Canada and U.S. today,

1:54:53.389,1:54:59.519
we can have world peace and we can specialize
on what areas we're good at, and trade with

1:54:59.519,1:55:02.780
one another, and not fight over limited resources.

1:55:02.780,1:55:06.209
I think things will proceed different this
time than they did in the 50's and 60's. Back

1:55:06.209,1:55:11.780
in the 50's and 60's, you had government appropriations
to national labs, which lead to the development

1:55:11.780,1:55:14.689
of this technology. I don't think that's how
it's going to happen this time. I think it's

1:55:14.689,1:55:18.659
going to be a fusion of the enthusiasts and
private industry.

1:55:18.659,1:55:23.050
Enough people now, thanks to the Internet,
are learning about the potential of LFTR and

1:55:23.050,1:55:24.659
thorium, and they're asking hard questions.

1:55:24.659,1:55:28.920
Mr. President, you often say there are no
silver bullets to our energy problems. Why

1:55:28.920,1:55:33.499
is the federal government not accelerating
research into fluid fuel molten salt reactors

1:55:33.499,1:55:35.030
that run on thorium?

1:55:35.030,1:55:38.729
Liquid fluoride thorium reactors, this is
the kind...

1:55:38.729,1:55:42.550
You're already above my pay grade so...

1:55:42.550,1:55:45.679
I'll explain it to you because this is the
kind of idea Washington needs to know about.

1:55:45.679,1:55:51.280
Pretty soon in 10 years we're going to buying
these things from them if we don't start making

1:55:51.280,1:55:54.729
them right now.

1:55:54.729,1:56:01.059
The AEC report given to John F. Kennedy at
his request in 1962, addresses directly the

1:56:01.059,1:56:07.459
fears that they had, and it specifically outlines
what we should have done. We have not done

1:56:07.459,1:56:11.769
it. We can do the thorium breeder reactor
which Weinberg and the Ornell team worked

1:56:11.769,1:56:18.070
on for 20 years and perfected and operated
for four years in the 1960's.

1:56:18.070,1:56:25.070
That reactor is exactly what China now has
a billion dollars to develop using our plans,

1:56:25.219,1:56:31.999
all our research, everything that we did as
an American research institution 49 years

1:56:31.999,1:56:38.329
ago. Even if Washington does operate slowly,
49 years does sound to be a little excessive.

1:56:38.329,1:56:41.959
If we don't do it, it will still be happening.
It will just be happening in a place like

1:56:41.959,1:56:46.090
China rather than the United States. We will
be seeing LFTRs being built in the future,

1:56:46.090,1:56:46.519
make no mistake.

1:56:46.519,1:56:50.729
A lot of environmentalists who are always
trying to drive us towards using less energy,

1:56:50.729,1:56:53.979
because all that energy's coming from the
consumption of fossil fuel.

1:56:53.979,1:56:58.260
Well, let's say your energy's not coming from
the consumption of fossil fuel. Then you could

1:56:58.260,1:57:03.309
use more energy, and you could use more energy
to accomplish things that you are not able

1:57:03.309,1:57:08.860
to do right now. Break up carbon dioxide and
dissociate water. Make fertilizer, grow crops,

1:57:08.860,1:57:09.619
all that.

1:57:09.619,1:57:14.889
So much energy, an abundance of energy, that
it would drive the price down to the point

1:57:14.889,1:57:19.619
where the only oil we'd be taking out of the
ground would be the easy to get to oil. And

1:57:19.619,1:57:24.079
there's not going to be any more environmental
devastation than there already is.

1:57:24.079,1:57:28.709
If we didn't have to worry about energy, we
could think of so many more things to do.

1:57:28.709,1:57:33.050
If there was a lot of it and it was cheap
and it was not harmful to the environment,

1:57:33.050,1:57:34.889
what would you do that you're not doing now?

1:57:34.889,1:57:39.139
The thing that caught my eye when I was still
in high school was the idea of a space solar

1:57:39.139,1:57:44.510
power satellite. Gerard O'Neill The High Frontier.
His idea was we were going to go build these

1:57:44.510,1:57:47.449
colonies. It was going to be like living in
a shopping mall in space.

1:57:47.449,1:57:53.559
You know and, have a little home in the tube.

1:57:53.559,1:57:56.840
I don't think we're ready to live in space
yet. We have not learned how to live in a

1:57:56.840,1:58:02.510
way where we recycle much more of our... I
mean, if you want to live in space, you've

1:58:02.510,1:58:03.689
got to recycle everything.

1:58:03.689,1:58:07.150
It seemed like the liquid fluoride thorium
reactor, or LFTR, could be the power source

1:58:07.150,1:58:11.900
that could make a self-sustainable lunar colony
a reality. But I have a simple question. If

1:58:11.900,1:58:17.170
it was such a great thing for a community
on the moon, why not a community on the earth,

1:58:17.170,1:58:18.150
self-sustaining and energy independent?

1:58:18.150,1:58:23.849
Think about "Star Trek." You can't help but
think about "Star Trek" when your name's Kirk.

1:58:23.849,1:58:28.360
What is the world of "Star Trek" running on?
Are they running "Star Trek" on coal? Are

1:58:28.360,1:58:32.469
they running "Star Trek" on oil sands? No.
You don't see any oil refineries on

1:58:32.469,1:58:34.269
"Star Trek". You don't see any coal mines.

We live much better lives today because we
have learned how to use carbon. OK, what about

1:58:40.439,1:58:47.389
thorium? Thorium has a million times the energy
density of a carbon-hydrogen bond. What could

1:58:47.389,1:58:52.809
that mean for human civilization going out
thousands, tens of thousands of years into

1:58:52.809,1:58:55.650
the future? Because, we're not going to run
out of this stuff. Once we've learned how

1:58:55.650,1:59:02.650
to use it at this kind of efficiency, we will
never run out.
